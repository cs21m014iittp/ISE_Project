absolute trash why on earth would you want to store payment info please fix how much data is used  please sort out the bookmarks bookmarks are not user friendly at all it needs to remember your last location in bookmark folders instead of having to go through then again to get to where you just were difficult to access saved logins  get back to the page you were on i dont allow this to use battery in the background yet it still does  cant reorder top sites

unusable on samsung galaxy phones since 2021 major update fenix big fan of the app but after months of struggling it is ending up in the bin hello duck duck basically every time you leave firefox to use a 2fa app copy content from another app validate a payment in your bank app  and come back to it 3 seconds after all the tabs are reloaded and the current state is lost all battery optimisation settings set in favor of the app though

almost satisfactory needs drag down to refresh for ease of checking that web page is properly loaded also you need to fix the issue with losing all private tabs if battery dies and phone shuts off

firefox now removes the buttons from android and operates in a full screen mode making it so you cant read the time or see your battery nor can you easily access the home back and index buttons i dont know if this is a new feature or a new bug but it makes using the browser more of a hassle than a convenience

ruined it they totally ruined the fact that firefox for android used to be a very low power consuming browser among the others from the store and now turned this into a battery draining one speed has significantly improved but  undo closed tab notice appears at a very inconvenient place while using the screen horizontally  tabs placements now cannot be reorganized in the drawer like it was always possible in the previous versions by simply dragging them around way to go mozilla

firefoxs latest update has shattered the app for normal usage links to the most popular site links twitter google etx no longer work the preview for browser tabs has been replaced with an unreadable slot interface and everything defaults to starting a new tab when you come back to the app resulting in multiple tabs sapping processing power this update has forced me to stop using firefox on my phone for the first time since investing in a smartphone its a real shame

you have to keep the app open in the background now if you dont want it to automatically default to the mozilla homepage every time you open it even though mozilla boasts about tracking protection etc i often get firefox is using battery notifications if i dont completely close it unimpressed with this update considering changing browsers if its not fixed

the new update has removed most characteristic and likable features of firefox long time an example of customizability and power this browser became so overstyled and streamlined that it falls in no category of usability anymore how can you do this drastic change on a simple update from which the people can not roll back

android version unfortunately still terrible after first fix to v80 very awkward access to bookmarks worse even in incognito the incognito start screen improves nothing and requires more clicks and motion for everything switching to just opened tab frequently requires scrolling despite performance claims loading sites is painfully slow serious lags in particular on mediajsheavy sites dialogues on sites frequently unclickable or jumping around battery usage is through the roof

review:-
this is a great browser with good ergonomics unfortunately there are some issues the first issue is that sometimes after resuming the browser a page doesnt load the only way to overcome this is to copy an url and follow it the second issue is a glitch line at the bottom of a page where an unsuitable part of a page is displayed it doesnt depend on the browser bar location the third issue is the battery drain even in the background when the browser hasnt been used for a long time

Match 1:
 bottom urlnavigation bar obscures bottom of page content on a short website where there is no scrolling the hidden content cannot be viewed as there is no way to scroll to hide the url bar
