19,40 of my battery was used in 12 hours  no single app on my phone or a group of them uses that much  it says firefox used 40 of the battery since last charge 12 hours ago under restricted mode this is not good and probably have to force stop anytime im not using it to save my battery  
320,promote all you want with turning red but the browser is still bad battery usage is still one of the highest amongst available browsers i guess not listening to feedback is also a skill
469,almost awesome still for some reason no matter how many plugins i use or dont use pages still stall when they are a quarter loaded just sits there for a while then finishes loading every page every time on all devices i tested on atleast 6 phones and tablets all battery restricted settings off etc etc still gonna use it but its anoyying great product otherwise
626,the background battery drain is baaaaad ive been using firefox on android never had much of an issue but in recent weeks ive found that firefox is eating through my battery more than any other app on my phone and i watch youtube for more hours per day than i do firefox this is a sign of an issue beyond my control i have disabled background data access closed all open tabs for now i am switching to beta to see if that helps
659,animations waste a lot of time please add an option to turn them off one animation may be less than a second but if you use the app a lot of time those microseconds add up sheer waste of time plus it uses more cpu power sheer waste of cpu power
664,theres a bug only with firefox whenever i put my samsung phone into maximum power saving mode it limits apps so you can add a select few to your home screen when i add firefox it works fine but when i edit the layout to remove or add a new app firefox disappears so i have to stop and resume power saving mode just for it to reappear from the available apps i can add this only happens to firefox
736,absolute trash why on earth would you want to store payment info please fix how much data is used  please sort out the bookmarks bookmarks are not user friendly at all it needs to remember your last location in bookmark folders instead of having to go through then again to get to where you just were difficult to access saved logins  get back to the page you were on i dont allow this to use battery in the background yet it still does  cant reorder top sites
1193,unusable on samsung galaxy phones since 2021 major update fenix big fan of the app but after months of struggling it is ending up in the bin hello duck duck basically every time you leave firefox to use a 2fa app copy content from another app validate a payment in your bank app  and come back to it 3 seconds after all the tabs are reloaded and the current state is lost all battery optimisation settings set in favor of the app though
1387,is using too much battery is top 1 on my cell without too much use i had to limit the background battery usage
1673,just works seems recently doesnt even eat too much battery
1690,drains a ton of battery on my phone running android 12
2255,desktop app has gotten worse for data collection thunderbird refuses to implement user requested features from 10 year old enhancement bugs memory leaks mobile version eats battery unless prevented from running in the background mozilla brain drain due to social justice politics
2316,i prefer firefox over all other browsers 3ven if it might take more processing power to handle it is the only truly stable browser out there right now
2326,allegedly awesome but has serious problems whats new tab doesnt give accurate info cant change wallpaper if neither option exists ff logo doesnt work  customize home has no such option also dark theme inop for most websites cant drag  reorder bookmarks to make them easier to find to delete browsing data you have to choose quit every time you exit or use private mode often has problems loading pages and battery drain is no better than samsung internet why bother
2774,battery consumption wise i belive this is the worst browser i love firefox but the increasing battery consumption makes me want to quit it
3351,mozilla firefox has been my favorite browser since netscape on android however they have some problems android devices say they are using too much battery when private mode is enabled and left on they have the same complaint about fairemail so im more inclined to believe this is just aggression against all open source apps firefox is their biggest browser competitor which is not based on chrome i have had similar problems with dolphin on android keep up the good work guys
3554,updates w features seem to cause problems that never shouldve got off the drawing board but the ability to watch youtube videos without ads using addons earns them a 355 despite becoming increasingly battery hungry too bad they have to compete with brave or theyd win but sorry brave is a better mobile browser
3689,now my back and home buttons along with clock and battery status disappear unless you swipe on the top or bottom of the screen what a pain in the rear to use the back button on my s21 completely ruined the browsing experience i want my factory samsung navigation buttons back
3732,almost satisfactory needs drag down to refresh for ease of checking that web page is properly loaded also you need to fix the issue with losing all private tabs if battery dies and phone shuts off
3851,firefox now removes the buttons from android and operates in a full screen mode making it so you cant read the time or see your battery nor can you easily access the home back and index buttons i dont know if this is a new feature or a new bug but it makes using the browser more of a hassle than a convenience
4328,need fullscreen option to hide phone clock and battery bar
4431,good app works perfectly but its a big battery eater
5286,it has a nice and easy ui but it consumes a lot of battery compared to chrome  opera it takes even a handful of space space is manageable but not battery please look into it one more piece of advice download sections can be disintegrated into filesimagesaudios etc
5570,still no history search drained 60 battery overnight still the only viable alternative to chrome  im developing stockholm syndrome
5614,i used to rate firefox as a 5 star browser but it has become a battery drain over the last week today it used over 50 of the battery for 15 minutes of active use
5645,battery drain when compared to chrome standalone adblocker is really bad
5741,i dont know why but firefox has been using a large amount of battery since the last update please fix it
6274,i cant use that garbage super slow wastes your time and makes your battery to die faster becase you spend more time on what you are looking for
6441,omg i have had such a hard time finding browser that not for the truth firefox also hides the things they dont want you to see or hearkevin hart was on shark tankwhy would they put him on air when everyone knows what lies n crimes he is charged for but when i wrote n asked things on firefox i was taken for a ride they hide the actors behavior alsouninstalling
6584,awfully resource hogging browser thats constantly draining the cpu forcing it to be flushed from memory by the os and losing my session also extremely buggy and not able to render banners and other web elements correctly on top of this it opts you in by default into running mozillas studies on your phone whatever that means and sends them your usage data
7270,new version still uses 20 battery on idle still has battery drain issues
7592,extremly good browser with adblocker a major drawback is that it consumes a vast amount of battery
7665,firefox is the only best choice for me but it getting slowdown the memory and draining battery percentage if i loaded plenty browser tabs
7844,needs a lot of update to get it working the same as old versionalso keep on getting battery warning fire fox not closing down how to shut of fire fox when not usingexit doesnt do itupdate i cant copy and pastlatest march update now firefox constantly crashing crash crash crash crash crashwelcome to crash foxcos thats all it doesmarch 20 updatetime for the bin updatewhy cant you fix itasap pleaseso many updates and yet firfox keeps crashing on ebay login
8133,app is ok needs work on power management and ram usage it takes a while to stop the app entirely too
8161,i have added 1 additional star and i feel most of the previous issues that i had posted about like battery drain but for addons and securenot invisible are strong patrick
8866,installed looking for more privacy but found the unopened app was draining my battery 37 in a few hours what are they running during the idle very suspicious uninstall
9001,way to many ads after update try reading news with low signal and youll see that it is so annoying i usually just give up and close the app and it uses more of my data  battery now
10602,more than a gigabyte of a browser 18gb  always  runs drains  battery after i quit from it every single time its get an update its become slover  by a bit bookmarks  are terrible mess and i forget mention the terrible looking new logo 
10891,what happened to addons no search bar in addons user interface bad edit there are a lot of popups redirects from websites in spite of addons the addons it seems are not doing what they are supposed to do with every update u r going downhill takes up lots of memory battery spacesize of app the whole experience of firefox is poor what is fill link from clipboard 12000 in the latest version
10927,use for an hr returned and still charging 2 weeks later
11120,stop updating stop adding new features stop changing my settings leave everything alone until the heat death of the universe
12052,can be energy drain for celphone if we let firefox on this why i re move 1 star but firefox is the most secure internet browser
12154,works but vastly inferior to its desktop version tab management is inconvenient no keyboard shortcut support mo controller support and uses a lot of battery youre better off using google chrome
12707,works ok but why in the world is it draining my battery like crazy android said it needed to stop ddain of my battery because of one app and its firefox wont be using it any more because of this also new tabs dont automatically get selected i have to quickly tap on open now or go to the menu to switch to the tab i just opened apparently im the only person who wants to automatically go to newly opened tabs
12741,after the recent updateit seems to drain more battery in my deviceandroid 10
12864,im a big fan of this browser the foundation behind it and it taking a stand against tracking but why does the phone in the screenshots here only have 14 and 6 battery remaining 
13063,honestly it works really well and the ui is superintuitive but heres the problem i usually only have to charge my phone once per day with firefox installed no addons normal settings i basically have to keep a mobile charger tethered to my phone
14048,139 drained in roughly 45 minutes thats with background data and such turned off its always been high in terms of battery consumption but 139 is just downright absurd
14626,why does firefox used more battery by simply turning background battery it makes no sense i sometimes open firefox to read on thing and when i noticed my battery drains quickly is caused by firefox using 30 to 40 by used for literally 3 minutes it is frustrating
14652,all the updates constant tinkering have made firefox very power hungry so it crashes often ive gone back to chrome  which just works
14864,constantly closes itself and refreshes any open page i leave it on when it doesnt which uses up unnecessary amounts of data and power
16767,overall quite stablethe synced tabs feature is very useful for viewing my desktop tabs on the go it is also compatible with the firefox quantum desktop addons ublock origin on an android phone is awesome my only gripe is that firefox on android can be a bit heavy on battery usage
17333,it was a good app but absolutely destroyed my battery my battery went from 3 days of use all day to less than a day and it is 100 because of firefox i had to get rid of it but i had no other complaints with it but its such a big one i have to rate it 2 stars
18219,the new update is good with better ui and some features but its main function that is browsing has become slow a bit and makes my phone heat up even more than when i use youtube its a great browser for privacy and stuff but please fix this asap
18404,amazing browser in terms of customization addons make it ideal for a power user it used to be my main but i moved to opera because frankly firefox is very very stuttery and cant maintain consistent performance when multitasking or even when running basic tasks
18808,new update is causing battery drain issues even when im not using the app the whole day it uses upto 30 of my battery
18889,ublock  background play fix thats what i use i have a job listening to audio through their browser 8 hours a day dozens of times a day i need to pull phone out see a reload  find my place in 2hr videowebpages crash multiple times an hour  i need to open  find my place ill push play hit power phone in pocket and literally 20 seconds later audio stops phone out open everything reloads because it crashed firefox needs competition hate dealing with this firefox mobile is broken
18985,mobile are so heating and so fast charging is down
19040,havent updated for about a year and checked the current version on a second phone  no thanks i will stay with the old version the new version lacks many addons the tabbar aboutconfig and i dont know what else  this is already more than enough to use the old version mozilla makes the same downgraded updates with the android version like they did with the desktop versions but which company doesnt as a power user i want the software to be used and look the way i like but this is more and more impossible being forced to use old and maybe unsecure versions which not only often have more features but often also a better ui
19149,latest version causes extreme cpu use makes phone drastically heat up and drains the battery of my android 11 phone just typing this paragraph used 3 of battery this is with all addons disabled other browsers chrome  duckgo do not exhibit this effect needless to say this renders it unusable too bad because firefox was my go to browser on android on windows desktop its still my favorite
19685,its great especially adblocker but the issue is with streaming sites its not well optimised at least not as chrome  uses more battery  also navigation guesture sucks new tabs are pane and cant perform slide guesture to change tabs
19687,the new geckoview based browser has been heating up my phone and constantly crashing or acting strange after opening too many tabs tab list blank control widgets disappearing ever since it was released last year im sure its amazing on current phones but its an absolute hog on my 2014 note4 hate to be forced to another browser but its currently unusable for me
20345,on a pixel 3xllatest os build as of 7621 phone became unstable battery draining and phone would reboot randomly even with 75 or higher battery charge uninstalled and have had zero issues since back to chrome i go
20421,i watch yt videos on firefox due to background playback support but due to some reason the video stops when i reload the firefox the tab refreshes and loads this is so frustrating please fix asap i dont have settings like battery saver on
20734,ok but drains battery very annoying when it drops back into the default loading page instead of scrolling back to a previous page chrome and opera perform much better on android
20847,app killed my battery over night in background very clunky ui mobile web surfing is such garbage in 2021
21832,slow rendering pages content jumps around both while loading and when some page elements refresh and battery life halved system reported ff consuming more than system itself update no pages open system claims it used 88 battery in the past 8 hours
22059,killing my battery by staying as a foreground task constantly unless i swipe it away in recents after each time im finished using it shame as i love firefox run as foreground task is being asked for and abused by so many apps now and theres no way of denying this permission though im sure its a bug in the case of firefox
22580,i will rate 5 star if you provide a option save as this browser also sucks a lot of power
22644,battery usage is still a little high but this is a fantastic browser
22881,the video playback needs to improveit lags sometimes and it needs to be more power efficient rest of the things are very good
24461,please let me disable background video playback silent videos are eating up my battery and old tabs are resuming playback unexpectedly just let us toggle background playback in the settings
24562,how do you have such a superior desktop browser and a subpar app 4 minutes of use was equal to 4 of my battery refresh is in the side menu and not a pull down action uninstalling for now will try again in a few months i guess
24609,the tab switcher is very inconvenient especially between private and normal tabs also the app makes the phone rather warm and drains the battery a bit other than that its alright
25375,opening the app it shut down my phone i was so scared i got hacked or something yes my phone was fully charged once i turned on my phone opened the app crash error tried several times same thing happened trash app 
25424,a great app overall fast and private but it drains a lot of battery even with advanced battery optimization
25865,1st need video assistant feature like samsung internet browser 2nd consuming high battery usage it is very heavy on battery
26011,bugs out the keyboard too much to bother using will randomly teleport where youre typing will randomly add letters when typing if you click into a textbox instead of going to the end of the textbox it drops you somewhere arbitrarily in the middle thought it was my phone or keyboard at first but every other app works fine moto g power standard google keyboard
26293,app suddenly stopped displaying websites correctly even mozilla support websites turned it to desktop opened it in safe mode restarted phone took out battery and put it in again reinstalled it again restarted it after reinstalling download another browser and it works just fine words appear in black squares and pictures seem either too elongated or glitchy to even be able to see have had this on my phone for 5 months now
26405,give my aboutconfig back until then ill be keep using chrome also dont ask me to switch to beta or nighty in that case i assume it as switch to chrome because why cant stable and aboutconfig exist together at all im power user i know what im doing and i want a stable browser
26634,very high battery usage wonder what this does in the background
28135,drains battery too much mozilla will have to fix this
28755,too bad it used to be a very good browser edit even worst now when in background it consumes battery if websites request it
28887,everything is first class but i have some issues while streaming youtube 1 when we play in fastforward the audio quality is crickling 2 when i try to play on full screen video not getting adjusted to screen properly also if i scroll down notification toggle and again sent it back the time and battery bar keep on staying in the video 3 video rotation issue as many users quoting videos are not rotating according to our position of mobile firefox please consider these
29962,cannot import bookmarks drains battery few extensions white line at top of the browser laggy when browsing large forum threads
30459,firefox was known for the ability to tweak everything but this mobile app changed to the complete opposite they deactivated the aboutconfig the addons are limited to a select few the tabs are reloading on selecting them or when they are in background so no listening to youtube on one tab while browsing on another at least most of the times its not working or just for 5 minutes firefox is excluded from battery saving so its not an android problem and neither youtube page
30529,too many permissions  intrusive ads  lacks of security features  did not block 3rd party trackers  3rd party cookies  lots of bug  consume a lot of ram  my battery drains fast   and why is it that everytime i go to facebook when i select the message tab it always open the messenger app  
30832,userfriendly if you ask me but for some reason most of times after quiting the app it keeps running on background and sucking battery
31260,it consumes battery more than chrome and also chrome works better with google search i choose firefox for privacy reasons but with these issues i will come back to chrome soon fix firefox please
31662,i cant search anything my phone power off ever time i search something it looks like this app contains virus
32035,xfininily network charge keyboard english message send emails tellusmore skydevice comwelcome to gboard clipboard any text you copy will be saved here
32235,gating addons isnt cool bruh give power back to da people
33028,firefox had been my preferred browser since it first debuted but this latest version has caused me to quit using it entirely 1 slower page loading overall sluggish performance 2 massive battery drain uninstalled ff and batterys running like a champ again 3 browser started freezing up eventually it started freezing my whole phone up 4 nowhere near enough user settings and extension support is depressingly laughable at this point 5 we still cant sort our bookmarks
33171,reporting you for not letting users uninstall the app completely this is bs and no one should even use your app at all  because i am warning everyone now it will kill your battery quick plus you wont be able to use your phone at all  this app is terrible 
33337,updated to four stars after some improvements were made the app is still a battery drain though the update made the app terrible features are missing and i cant even scroll past images without it jumping to the top or bottom of the page
34319,much better than it used to be and doesnt drain your battery like chrome does
34872,kills my pixel 3 xls battery granted thats not hard since the phone is also garbage but this performs worse than most browsers
34883,a good browser but sadly unlike my pc my mobile phone isnt a nasa computer but one of those cheap ones without the heft and juice to melt an arctic iceberg so with regrets i have to use a sub par browser instead of this magnificent piece of wonderously and highly sophisticated software but seriously optimization is a thing but then firefox often used close to one gb of ram on my pc but yeah other than that its hands down the best browser
35051,just garbage and slow uses way too many resources and kills battery brave is so much better
35275,sluggish and a resource hog drained battery and used up too much memory new version is horrible so i looked for something better switched to a browser that is way faster and has great features bye mozilla
36183,horrific usability bookmarks not easily accessible also runs in background and drains battery despite removing autostart permissions ff for desktop my favorite browser just not for mobile
37009,battery life hog on huawei mate 20 and samsung s20 fe
37757,needs work chrome is objectively a better browser in every sense faster better ui less bugs less battery usage the list goes on the only thing keeping me are the extensions this is the only way to get a decent ad blocker on android without rooting or using some sketch privacy browser however even extensions need work because you can only use 12 out or the 1000s available for desktop which never used to be the case wth
38196,not as easy on battery or memory as i would like but worth it to use firefox make sure you turn off their silly wifi locator service to get rid of that annoying background battery usage notification
38425,a pc like browsing experience but a power hungry monster please make it light on resources
38791,very taxing on battery life probably a bug  not yet as speedy as promised with the new update but its getting better
38910,new updates drain my battery like crazy now 100 to 50 in 4 hours and im not even actively using my phone during that time aside from the saved password popping up correctly now literally none of the changes have been helpful
39392,latest update started consuming over 80 battery had to uninstall to even charge the phone 6 months later its still a battery hog lame
39788,i am unable to shut off the camera and voice or sound and it keeps draining my battery
40374,the last update is really nice but i noticed an increased battery power consumption also the youtube videos dont scale well with the screen on my redmi note 7 and its important because i use youtube on firefox to avoid watching ads for everything else is doing well update youtube dont resize well the screen on fullscreen so part of the video is unseen mostly subtitles please fix the issue i dont use youtube app because the insane amount of ads
40606,eats so much battery and data compared to other browsers  its fast tho
42064,firefox app used to be great recently it has gone downhill fast ive noticed firefox using background data and battery despite these settings specifically being turned off for it i force stop the app to prevent this and it just turns itself on some time later time to chose an alternative browser that doesnt have ulterior motives
42248,ruined it they totally ruined the fact that firefox for android used to be a very low power consuming browser among the others from the store and now turned this into a battery draining one speed has significantly improved but  undo closed tab notice appears at a very inconvenient place while using the screen horizontally  tabs placements now cannot be reorganized in the drawer like it was always possible in the previous versions by simply dragging them around way to go mozilla 
42674,been a fan on ff for many years ever since the update many things have gone down the drain the layout changes are not intuitive eg toolbar is up but to add new tab the  is below history and offline site data now has less control than before really regretted clicking on the update button not withstanding the above comments now i cant even move tabs downgrading to one star what a sad turn off events
43313,new  the downloads are always stuck and not charging the bar remains gray forever on other navigators it works im on miui 1105 it works when i long press the download url and choose  download link but its kind of annoying
44161,used to be an excellent browser has been my goto android browser app for the longest time lately it seems everytime i launch the app my phone alerts me for the app creating abnormal battery drain i end up killing the app process going to applications  storage and cache  clearing storage mozilla please fix this app
44494,browsing is generally good but performance is lacking also consumes much more battery than chrome
44861,25062015 characters too smal in facebook web page 03062015 fast inly for a higher hardware performance25042014 unfortunately after 1 month of use it is still hungry consume a lot of cpu power thus decrease battery life 22032014 aprs installation je voit une grande amlioration depuis la premire vue mais jattends  lutiliser dabord avant de donner mon avis final
45065,firefox used to be a simply great browser now it is not they keep adding bells and whistles that slow it down and make it burn battery life
45213,2 windows of firefox opens simultaneously when i open the browser on my oneplus 8t this consumes more ram  battery please fix this issue
45730,was the best now just awful latest upgrade terrible leaves tabs open eats up battery seems like a useless beta version not ready for launch looks like going to have to use chrome come on mozilla get this mess sorted
45829,not private not acceptable even though all privacy and security settings are set to the most restricted level and i use qwant as search engine im still targeted with ads in other apos that are clearly and directly related to my previous searches in the firefox browser in addition this app runs in the background and uses ca 3 of battery per hour even though background activity is disabled
45839,firefoxs latest update has shattered the app for normal usage links to the most popular site links twitter google etx no longer work the preview for browser tabs has been replaced with an unreadable slot interface and everything defaults to starting a new tab when you come back to the app resulting in multiple tabs sapping processing power this update has forced me to stop using firefox on my phone for the first time since investing in a smartphone its a real shame
46726,looking more like a good browser still missing home screen still missing broader add on support i am also noticing hefty battery drain due to firefox13 since last full charge12 hours its better hopefully keeps getting better
47844,much buggier than the previous version background power draw it drains my battery like mad tabs that just refuse to do anything youll need to restart the app tabs that randomly refresh just after you spend 5 minutes on editing a comment very agressive tab unloading from memory it just keeps a few tabs in memory on my 4gb phone previous verion could easily have 10 open i feel were back to the buggy browsers of the year 2003 alpha software not production ready
48615,i have been a user of firefox for the past 10 plus years and never thought to use another browser as the functionality was excellent new version eats battery crashes three or four times daily fails to load many sites hangs at 25 load bar doesnt auto fill my saved usernames and passwords saved against my account unless i search for them and load from the menu dropdown etc i have now reluctantly switched to chrome please fix or give us back the previous version before firefox daylight
48661,longtime user of firefox but this latest update really is awful huge battery and data drains addons only half work and suspicious activity while the app was supposed to be off there was a time when i thought firefox could have really competed with chrome but it seems greed and short sightedness got in the way i can no longer recommended firefox to friends or family
49470,i use the pc version for more than 10 years i think but recently the pc version is a pain to use the most memory hungry programme in windows and the plugin container always crashes but in android it is far better only thing i miss that the cache clear option and tracking deactivation option update 30092010 after the latest update whenever i connect to internet in my moto g4 plus the system is showing that firefox is using battery without opening it why is that
50106,my phone says this is draining my battery it also doesnt support last pass
50967,recently updated it to a new and improved version it no longer supports an addon that i do not browse without and the application is a huge drain on my battery
51219,need more feature and addon extention use more battery than usual browsers
51488,ever since the new update the app keeps running in the background wasting battery even though i keep putting it to sleep
51961,extremely high battery drain on my device there are multiple people on forums everywhere complaining about this i tried reinstalling but that was a waste of time and lost all my ff data because sync didnt really synchronize my data back to finding another browser ffs to addtheyve removed all but a handful of addons useless browser now
52138,it seems to drain the battery much faster than other browser
52225,i use this browser because it allows me to reorder my tabs manually which is a lifesaver but firefox drains my battery like crazy
53732,past 3 or 4 days my firefox app is draining battery at a crazy rate even after ive closed the app  10 in 3045 minutes force stopping firefox brings battery drain to normal until the next time i launch it i dont want to uninstall it because its the one i use across platforms but having to manually force stop everytime im done with the browser not an option either and the interface frankly sucks
55465,total trash i completely agree with pretty much every 1 star rating that has been written over the last couple weeks now my phone keeps warning me that firefox is using battery i cant stop it force stop clear cache restart phonenothing works only option is to uninstall
55773,well there are a lot of reviews saying what i want to say so let me tell what the app does which it shouldnt app nowadays seems to crash a little more frequentlyusually when on the same website for a long time if i leave my app open without using it in the background after some time my phone recommends me to force stop as it drains more battery than required i browse in incognito mode if you need to know and if you can please release a new app which consists the old version
56372,this is not an improvement with all permissions turned off set for no background data no background battery use within an hour and a half it used 34 of my battery
56831,you have to keep the app open in the background now if you dont want it to automatically default to the mozilla homepage every time you open it even though mozilla boasts about tracking protection etc i often get firefox is using battery notifications if i dont completely close it unimpressed with this update considering changing browsers if its not fixed
57200,the most important drawback of the update is that the newest update is draining my battery i also cant get used to the new tab system and am not a huge fan of the home screen but the battery issues may cause me to stop using altogether edit dropping review from 3 stars to 2 the load times are also significantly worse
57646,new update is totally broken many sites i use daily mostly simple image boards and forums are completely failing to load content app is slow and crashes frequently address bar at the bottom is good in theory but if i have to tap 6 differ things to open a new tab instead of 2 thats a problem deleted half of my favorite sites from the home tab and replaced them with google and other generics that i havent used in years it also uses way more battery and causes my phone to get very hot
57779,the update is a great advert for browsers from huge corporations that suck up our data opens additional tabs whenever its opened hangs and seems much slower i also now get warnings about high battery usage
58039,the new update has removed most characteristic and likable features of firefox long time an example of customizability and power this browser became so overstyled and streamlined that it falls in no category of usability anymore how can you do this drastic change on a simple update from which the people can not roll back
58118,i have been using firefox desktop and android for my business and personal use for years but i am very disappointed in the latest update to firefox android it eats battery power and requires extra steps to get where i want to go i am actually looking for other options
58133,new version is mess customization is poor some settings seem missing very radical change and feel even with the new energy saver mode it seems to burn through the battery almost twice as fast since it was the only upgrade done it seems pretty bad very disappointing upgrade
58270,the latest update is slow it seems to burn my battery down quickly it holds all my history in tabs it doesnt clear my history like i had settings for in the previous version hate it if i can find a way to revert back to the previous version i will
58863,very bad and slow is going on using my phoen battery
60011,android version unfortunately still terrible after first fix to v80 very awkward access to bookmarks worse even in incognito the incognito start screen improves nothing and requires more clicks and motion for everything switching to just opened tab frequently requires scrolling despite performance claims loading sites is painfully slow serious lags in particular on mediajsheavy sites dialogues on sites frequently unclickable or jumping around battery usage is through the roof
60588,this is a great browser with good ergonomics unfortunately there are some issues the first issue is that sometimes after resuming the browser a page doesnt load the only way to overcome this is to copy an url and follow it the second issue is a glitch line at the bottom of a page where an unsuitable part of a page is displayed it doesnt depend on the browser bar location the third issue is the battery drain even in the background when the browser hasnt been used for a long time
61401,awful after the latest update unstable on older hardware tabs structure makes no sense and gets even the basics wrong  which tab is what and which tab is open always opens up a new tab on launch  why websites render weirdly and apparently its a resource hog that drains my battery in the background come on mozilla you can do better
64224,18 years with firefox this new upgrade sucks cuts off all podcasts in one to two minutes if you dont keep the window open like your watching a video burns up battery power throws all your bookmarks out of order i never liked the way firefox bookmarked any ways you had to start with a clean slate and enter them in the order you wanted them had about a hundred no option to alphabetize or move them the way one wants them like i said liked it before the newest update bye bye firefox
64563,mozillas failure as a company has rendered this once great mobile browser into unusable trash the massive hemorrhaging of battery life has forced me back to chrome so sad
64895,the new update removed what made firefox on android special compared to chrome firefox will always be an inferior browsing experience and the removal of desktop add on support and the other customization options took away my final reasons to use firefox without what made firefox the special browser that it was why should i use it its slower uses more battery and has inferior rendering to googles product its a shame mozilla leadership wont suffer for their incompetent direction
64943,the updated firefox looks terrible and functions worse than chrome drains my battery quickly too i get that mozilla needs money but why are they going about it the way google did with subtely gathering peoples information through offering a streamlined experience efficiency in the tech world is code for users being the product usually bottom bar thing is asinine at best and more an amateurish attempt to be new with this update revert back or come out and say that alphabet inc or whatever company operates the google umbrella is forcing parameters in order to be available on the play store
66300,since new update its killing my battery 10 usage running in the background
67988,junk ruined a good thing no longer opens to the page you were on instead this new tab garbage ui nothing wrong with the old one stoprefresh now hidden away automatically landscapes videos where you used to have the option for fullscreen portrait why change these features for no reason at least give us the option to add them back or actual customization like the desktop app also takes forever to load randomly and seems to consume way too much battery running in the background
69358,if it aint broke then put the teaboy in charge mozilla seem to be heading the same way as google just doing whatever they want and only listening to the fanboys who are literally creaming over the bottom bar that everyone else hates the way to make an app less of a battery drain is to make it more efficient not recreating the ui to distract from the fact much of the functionality has disappeared
69502,i have used firefox for many years in my pc but this android version is very bad it is draining my battery fast after update also i dont like the address bar that is now at the bottom also the private tab has moved to some place else
72704,was great up until the last update which made the ui awful it covers the time and battery bar at the top and is very slow
73689,its a battery eater and crashing on every opening tab nothing change to improve performance
end 1st half,still high battery usage on latest ff when viewing google colab the battery usage is significantly higher monitored using battery charging monitor even if i close the page google colab the battery usage stuck at higher level i had to force stop firefox to fix this please look into this issue why does it spike to high battery usage when viewing google colab your service suck you never reply reviews and emails
start here,firefox 79 is the most beautiful browser right now the ui refresh is much welcomed it seems faster and draines less battery browsing is more smooth the different levels of tracking protection is also besutiful 5 stars all the way default browser is now firefox
74626,new version  disaster ive been using firefox for android for a long time but i will change to other browser new ui is extremely confusing no way to set your bookmarks on the initial page many crashes sometimes the desktop version of the website is charged instead of the mobile even if the option is not active what a pity i loved firefox so far 
74960,dark mode is great but the loading screen  the blank screen while loading a web page are fully white a nice eyestraining blinding oversight that makes dark mode only helpful to the battery
74963,before this was the best now crashes often only few addons are enabled no media controls on videos drains battery and the quick navigate thing is now gone in new tabs downgrade 
75019,best browser out there with the power of addons its all you need for a perfect web experience 
75057,ive been using firefox for 10 to 15 years its power and freedom to do what you want and not what they dont want you to do is my favorite thing about firefox
75067,years this was my favorite browser no longer this is hot garbage now the new update doesnt load tabs in the background anymore which means data stops if i turn off the screen to continue browsing later everyone knows the screen illumination eats battery life the most so this feature is counter productive especially for users who have unlimited data and there is no work around it time to switch my default browser after all this time
75237,last update is such a setback tabs are weird thumbnails are not working half the time broken autocompletes no addons no aboutconfig no tab reordering worse home screen zooming feels weird and at times glitchy you took a good browser where power users like me enjoy and reduced it to this good job mozilla 1 less user for you and if your desktop follows this trend you will lose me there as well
75528,the new automatic nondowngradeable update made firefox totally unusable im experiencing strange behavior on some sites strange behavior when i enter a urlgetting suggestions based on history with foreign characters mainly   and  i dislike the ugly ui and for some reason it disabled some of my extensions without the ability to enable them again im what some would say a power user and firefox on windows and on android have always been for people like me but not anymore it seems
75603,the latest update 79 doesnt let us use aboutconfig for power users whats up with that
75796,this new version of firefox needs fixing pages are not being rendered consistently if you temporarily open another app then return to firefox the page you were on does not show sometimes even a refresh or pressing the address bar to reenter the page doesnt work even the memory management of private tabs is not good i charged my phone which was not off then once fully charged my tabs were gone
76012,each update only to make worst now drains my battery in less than 1 hour absolutely garbage useless
76605,i guess we will never have customizable start page with folder bookmarks and convenient speed dials its the heaviest browser and the most inconvenient for power users with a lot of bookmarks the redesigned version goes from bad to annoying
76652,ive been a firefox power user since first released on both pc and android i like my browser to work the way i want it to  ill use chrome if i want to be spoonfed its a sad day when i have to downvote firefox but the latest version is terrible the renderer is a mess theyve disabled aboutconfig for nonbeta settings is a ghost town i can no longer start in bookmark view by default top sitescollections lets reinvent the wheel but with triangles id go on but theres no room
76880,i would give it to 5 stars if it wont drained my battery like a waterfall
76914,best browser as it has extension support but it has insane battery usage like 3040 usage on my phone
77131,heats up and kills battery within an hour of full charge
77197,draining battery for reasons unknown unable to reduce the power consumption
77374,i switched away from firefox 5 years ago because while it was decently quick it crashed constantly and was a memory suck i came back and after 2 days of use i can tell you its a different experience the browser still sucks your memory and drains your battery and the tabs still crash constantly bit now the browser absolutely crawls this browser operates like abandonware and its baffling to know that people still work at mozilla and are like doing work every day its just trash
77916,was great but now draining battery by using 25 cpu when sitting in background
78177,been using firefox since version 3 on windows and was happy to see they made the android version as i rather stick to a browser i already know and trust best thing about this is being able to sync my tabs between my pc and smartphone and its as fast on my phone even with multiple tabs open and does not drain my battery disappointed that no addons i installed works so far but maybe that will improve in the future
79264,it drains the battery since the last update i have to charge my phone twice a day when i used to charge it once every day an half
79379,what i need to power browse needs dark background  screenshot option 
79586,much slower than the competing browsers does not leave me in the desired position on the webpage but throws me automatically on a random place also it gobbles cpu time battery and available memory uninstalled
79850,very good app it will drain your battery with a lot of tabs open but thats on the end user i like that you can access ftp servers with it too well deserving of 4 stars but not quite 5
80102,firefox preview is the best and fastest android browser around but this version is also great the plugins are very handy along with the ability to listen to youtube videos while the screen is locked or while using other apps is also very handy and great for battery longevity 910 for this version and 1110 for firefox preview i feel ff preview will end up being the 1 mobile browser in time
80202,great browser but quite slow to start up and uses an excessive amount of gpu power for some videos
80268,latest updates make this a battery eating machine will give 5 stars when battery usage goes back to reasonable
80329,just great just fine just the power i needed yo rock on
80537,caused battery drain firefox on pc is a lot better
80995,i like how firefox is very secure however when i installed it on my new phone the battery started to drain a lot faster at first i thought i had a virus but my security scan found nothing i uninstalled firefox and my battery is lasting now i dont know what happened but it needs to have better battery optimization
81455,disgusting it drains battery faster than other browsers and i recommend not to use
81707,i was a huge firefox fan until i found out the browser was draining my battery had to uninstall please fix in future updates
81891,thank you love this browser please one feature request i have 100 tabs open please provide an option that restricts tabs using the cpu which are not used many times firefox is the main thing draining my battery thanks guys good work edit as far as i know they did this with the new version thx edit2 why are you not allowing the app data to be backed up you have not set flag flagallowbackup why how am i supposed to transfer all settings extensions etcgoing back to 4 stars
82241,everyone should visit browserbetter com to install the best browser app its block ads privacy and faster firefoxs great app but every time i download something even once its finished i have a persistant notification saying its still downloading stuck on a high number like 87 or 99 ive noticed increased battery drain while this occurs too to stop it i either need to forceclose the app in settings or restart my whole phone
82301,firefox is getting power hungry now days is it possible to make it less battery consuming uninstalled change back to chrome and walah now my phone battery can last for years
82524,great app but every time i download something even once its finished i have a persistant notification saying its still downloading stuck on a high number like 87 or 99 ive noticed increased battery drain while this occurs too to stop it i either need to forceclose the app in settings or restart my whole phone please fix
83077,good mozilla this is a great and secure browser for both light users and power users
83171,do firefox have an add free browser that they charge for if so how do i cancel an accidental payment
83347,extensions make firefox the best choice for browsing and downloading content on mobile devices it has built in adblockers ublock origin custom user agent integration with download managers bookmark and history constantly syncing with desktop and lets not forget privacy all this makes it the foremost choice for a basic as well as a power users need
83364,this is a power browser i really like the extensions that i can install i am disappointed that i cant use the app on my dex station samsung s 10  it would be amazing if it work on dex mode 
83572,i am absolutely happy with this web browser i have been using it for a long time on both my laptop and android phone the only thing its not an issue or complain though that i have noticed is that is consumes more power batteryenergy on my phone and data i just want to thank the developers for their colossal improvements over the years keep doing the good work
83660,good application unfortunately the letdown is i get notified of the battery usage on it  had to go
83776,drains the battery like nothing else video playback crashes frequently hangs requiring force stop too often its not really usable if you want to keep your sanity
83990,would be better if it didnt make me phone over heat or drain my battery
84152,been happy with app for ages now it is raping the battery app info says 8 but battery usage setting is 37  more than the screen uninstalling now
84862,im happy with the idea of an open source project but for an average person the browser is quite confusing other than that its a great power full browser a huge thank you for your effort
85047,good application but really need to be able to group tabs so i dont need to always have 20 or 30 open just so i can keep an eye one a few different websites at once if i was able to group windows in different groups it would solve my battery being drained and save alot of time plus i would put 5 stars
85354,battery hog i want to love firefox for the mission and nongoogleness of it but it destroys my battery background battery usage is insanely high have closed tabs told phone to put it to sleep in background and it still eats up 35 of battery overnight when phone is idle and im asleep
85506,update ok ive been using this browser on and off for about 4 years i was really enjoying it but ever since the more recent updates it has gotten slower and it seems like it has taken steps backwards to the point where it has become almost unusable cant wait till the redesign comes out i like it but it keeps uninstalling after reboot when i do a system update and phone restarts i have to reinstall firefox when battery dies and i recharge and turn phone on i have to reinstall
85657,battery drains fast when playing videos in the background as opposed to other browsers
85850,pretty great having firefox on my phone but it seems that for some reason its always on in background and therefore drains my battery galaxy s5
86057,so this aop has sped up since my last review but it is a power hog 11 of my power
86164,this app drain battery more than other browser a lot and my cell phone is getting hot after 10mins using other browser like dolphin is much better
86201,battery hog good browser but it uses way too much battery and memory it actually overloaded my cellphone and i had to uninstall it
86203,i tried it because i wanted an alternative to chrome but im very disappointed the difference between them is huge chrome is better in any aspect firefox charge pages very slowly it cant block all the advertising it recharge more time the same page while im reading it its not compatible with a lot of app for external link and these are just few little problems i found using it the browser is ok for general use but too many little thinks issues etc create a very unfriendly browser
86395,nice but it kills my phone battery if application not closed it sucks 70 of the phone battery in a couple of hours of my galaxy s9 it must be a bug but no new version released yet
86457,firefox is great for accessing blocked sites and to register for social media accounts which other browsers like operamini would not register for you it would have a 5 star from me like i already rated it from my experience of this version it is reliable in speed and processing power when browsing the internet like am a web programmer i ise firefox to open my cpanel when creating a website and it makes the dashboard interface wider to access all softaware feastures
86648,it used to be my default browser but since the last update it drains my battery 2146 of my daily usage and i havent opened it today rubbish
86717,great mobile browser you can sync it with your desktop for bookmarks and has all the features and power of the regular desktop version of firefox firefox fan since 2006
86726,191 mb on my phone drains as much battery as a phone made in the early 2000s
86796,thanks for enhance tracking protection  now i can browse without seeing any ads on my web pages thank you once again because now i can browse without my phone getting heat and the browser now consumes less battery  it is really now beyond classy it is the best browser right now on google play store with this update  but one more request please can you ad for us hiding phone notification bar and videos assistant  thank you
86995,used over 1gb of storage constantly runs my battery dead there are better mobile browsers
87227,i l liked it but unfortunately it drains the battery in background disinstalled
88246,golf now  twice has over charged my account due to their screw ups no one to talk to  no place for help and feed back i would seriously consider not using this app
88586,i use firefox on my pc and i prefer its mobile version to chromes better layout reader view noticeably less ad targeting etc but unfortunately this app is totally unusable for me because it drains my phones battery for some reason this happened on 2 or 3 different devices in multiple attempts over the course of a few years i install and use the app my battery starts going down fast i go look for the culprit and firefox has an unreasonably high  of battery usage a fatal flaw
88682,very slow and full of annoying notifications when i run it even after exiting it drains the battery of my phone making it really hot until i reboot the phone then it has the hide to pop up messages telling me to use firefox to reduce my carbon footprint i think ill uninstall it and go back to chrome as i can actually browse a web page with that and not have to dismiss so many pointless notifications that insult me and waste my time
88915,battery consumption very high  i think its double to my previous samsung browser
89158,works great but crippling battery drain on galaxy s8 other well known browsers work better
89265,simple elegant customizable fast and powerful without eating hardware power
89309,excessive battery drain when im not using my phone even with sleep options enabled
89931,battery usage has been crazy for a few weeks switching back to samsung internet until the issue gets fixed
90027,im not sure if it really drains much of my battery life quickly or just a bug on the battery api but all in all its a good browser thank you
90104,this works well enough but a lot of pages arent formatted correctly and i have to open them in chrome the worst part and why im uninstalling is that it absolutely kills my phone battery it uses about 3x as much battery as chrome
90196,such a power hog sucked up my battery within a few hours
90269,i love this browser but it drains my battery i am forever getting notifications about putting it to sleep because it is using too much power i may have to stop using it for that reason
90305,this app has vastly improved over the years but still uses illogical amounts of battery reading just one short article from my email could eat 10 of my battery life within less than 5 minutes
90950,people who care about privacy should stop using chrome and switch to firefox really glad that firefox exists with more features for power users and extension support other browsers simply cannot match firefox
91252,seems theyve finally fixed the hanging issue with the quit option getting stuck trying to clear private info it clears it almost instantly  closes the app thank you so much  now i wish it would actually kill the process properly instead of leaving it running in the background taking up megabytes of ramwhich translates to eating battery life unnecessarily
91423,the experience was very much like playing an easy game that would make some like me who have a little knowledge about the new gadgets a savvy person of electronics i would then say that i would recommend this app to anyone thanks for sharing this app keep it up and more power guys
91518,good browser however it drains my phones battery while running in the background would rate 5 stars if the browser wasnt so inefficient
91858,wildly fast huh takes like 5 minutes to load even with good wifi this is clearly not designed for android and no effort was put into this app to optimize it for these systems also it drains the battery like crazy
92527,i have been using firefox for a while without any issue but just recently i noticed that is draining my mobile data in a surprising way
92554,my main gripe though is the widget i love having a search bar widget on my home screen this one basically saves you a single click to search than just opening the app normally 1 issue though is the lack of widget options customization i have dark themed icons and home screen like the look and battery saving the only option for this widget is a boxy white bar no options for color icon shape transparency etc i must be the only person who cares because i found no info anywhere
92721,this was my favorite browser until your latest updates random crashes slow response high battery usage in addition it keeps freezing when watching live streams which dont have problems on chrome though and i rather not go back to chrome so fix it pleasesamsung galaxy tab s3 smt825
93055,get the customisable private  free mobile browser that syncs across devices experience a fast smart and personal web firefox is the independentpeoplefirst browser made by mozilla voted the most trusted internet company for privacyupgrade today and join hundreds of millions who depend on firefox for a more personal browsing experience fastsmartsecure firefox is made with my mind and gives me the power to take back control of my web experiencemeet my expectations and gif supportthanks 
93065,it is very fast and in order for u to get to save ur battery u must go into settings and go to the battery and start saving
93265,everything is great but when watching movie on the browser it eats too much battery can you optimize this pls ill give you 5 stars if you do
93310,love mozilla and firefox but the android version murders my phone battery life
93467,firefox for pc is the best browser out there but somehow on andriod it becomes terrible uses to much cpu and ram and gives worst battery back up
93672,had to uninstall twice in the past week my phone has run out of battery in the middle of the day firefox is always the top battery user at over 25 and i dont use it much
93816,ridiculous amount of battery drain 30 in a matter of 2 hours when phone was at idle with the screen off i tried giving you guys another chance oh well
93989,if youre not using chrome this is the next best or better thing pages load fast doesnt kill your battery its a solid web browser
94378,gets worse with each update  it eats up way too much space vs samsung internet and chrome lags like crazy and bookmarks option stopped working data builds up way too quickly which increases battery and memory usage once i clear it everything via firefox ie bookmarks that i put on the home screen goes with it whose idea was this  samsung internet doesnt do this and this wasnt a problem in the past uninstalled it no longer saw a point in keeping it  stars for design only
94590,no visible bookmarks toolbar i like being able to get to things fast and for the life of me i cannot figure out the settings on this or how to properly sync i love firefox better than any browser and it doesnt drain things like chrome does but this app doesnt come up to standard on a chromebook
94626,firefox is tops imho yes it has some issues but then it is a work in progress but that is the nature of the beast mozila are constantly improving or developing their product and more power to them they are focussed on our needs so help them to go forward and stop moaning
94664,extention support is good but battery drain is a major issue please solve tihs
94903,hopefully not tracking so much as google chrome but crashes constantly eats battery a lot even if set as default browser some apps still use chrome or embedded android browser to open links
95234,long time firefox user but seeing more and more issues with pages not loading properly switch to chrome and they load fine even worse though last few updates are causing significant battery drain like you mozilla but need to get issues fixed asap
95514,doesnt feel quite right but the reason i uninstalled it is the battery drain
95524,i used firefox browser on my phone for a while its great to usehowever ive experienced major battery problems in my settings is using more than 40 of battery power to than any other apps on my phone
95666,poor notworking for most website compatability issue consume more power
95676,this is very slow it would be nice to hear from a person who in charge
95857,got this app as chrome kept redirecting me to an unsafe website which i couldnt stop great app apart from drains battery faster
95905,huge battery drain on 1st gen pixel had to remove
96011,good job more details weve had bad and good days with mozilla everyone had but even if they cannot satisfy us all they always followed their original goal and purpose to perfection it is the only reason today you access the web freely however you want many others would have been swallowed a long time ago by the giants profit making overlords of technology and web youve resisted temptation youve won the challenge of modernization you give us power everyday thnx long life mozilla
96124,ditch chrome firefox is the best 1010 for giving the power back to consumer privacy  superfast browser well done team firefox
96217,hmm well i swapped to this from chrome because this is clearer and easier to change the security and privacy settings which are better no doubt the trouble is this browser seriously drains my tablet battery and it doesnt load certain website pages well giving me black squares amazon is the worst i shall stay with firefox for a while longer then try another if it doesnt improve
96534,overall firefox is fantastic sadly it uses a pretty substantial amount of battery on my phone oneplus 6t even days where i barely touched my phone firefox was number one in battery use and on those days i had podcasts playing for hours and that app was number two in the list so odd sadly i had to uninstall because of the battery drain issue
96697,more cpu and battery intensive but more versatile than chrome still i appreciate that it renders pages equally as well as a desktop browser when i tap request desktop site to be fair im using it for tasks that even i7 desktops find demanding such as multiple amazon tabs the availability of plugins such as bitwarden and ublock origin is invaluable samsung galaxy s7 ps like open in new tab shows a switch to tab briefly in the corner dislike save as is missing
96884,when watch an adult video through the browser and i push the power button to turn the screen off the video keeps playing while the screen is turned off also its not polished as a browser when a search result comes up sometimes there is a border around each search result
96897,say no to the chromium cartel firefox is still the best browser for power users on pc and rather good on android as well
96951,addons are a big advantage but the performance is bad eating much battery and that even on a samsung galaxy s7 edge
97021,decent performance and many extensions are available also plenty of customization is possible battery usage is okay main disadvantage is lack of a decent dark mode with dark mode extensions performance is slowed and there are white flashes if you care about dark mode or want something faster check out samsung browser
97022,no built in dark mode add this feature to save battery and to keep our eyes healthy
97472,data stealing wont close runs in background stealling using power
97639,the last update added bloatware and push notifications to tell you about the additional features draining your battery no one asked for
97645,i thought it is a good idea to switch from chrome to   but sadly mobile firefox condumes more power and its comparatively slow to chrome now even in pc its slower than chrome thanks devs for letting our faith down on you 
97692,the only major browser that still cares about your privacy and believes in giving power to the user you can already get a glimpse of the dystopian future google has in mind for the internet with how theyre making things harder for adblock extentions as a part of manifest v3 firefox was my first browser and once ads started popping up again this switch was a no brainer
97735,it was supposed to work almost everything my battery are 4hrs later  disapirering and downloading it every 30mins useless
97815,it consumes a lot of battery and dataplz dont install i am giving one star the app deserves zero star
97884,slow and wastes battery i use firefox on my desktop but on mobile its so very slow to load pages or do anything its unusable and stressful cant copy any text i highlight which is annoying due to this feature being basic on other browsers great addons and how the tabs are laid out but speed is aweful i have tried a fresh install without addons and still very slow uninstalled and using opera instead which is very fast i can live without addons because i can open pages fast properly
98043,so after not used firefox for awhile i decided to give it another try after using it for a few days i noticed significant battery drain compared to chrome along with that pages take 23x times longer to load and have timed out due to inactivity from browser went back to chrome and no longer have battery drain issues and pages are loading quickly again phone is an lg v35 thinq running android 8 slow speeds were on both att 5ge mobile data and on home 140mps down wifi
98396,originally got this as an alternative to chrome on an old pc of mine it has never worked properly taking up to 10 minutes just to restore one tab freezes constantly and uses up almost all the power my pc had it claims to be fast yet even on an octacore 15ghz phone core2 quad 24ghz pc and numerous other devices it runs worse than chrome runs on my 99 dell dimemsion l550r  id reccomend staying far away from firefox
98441,this browsing app has huge battery consumption which really sucks because i prefer it over chrome for many reasons but it just drains my battery too fast i have my phone plugged in and charging while using the app and my battery percentage is still going down at an alarmingly fast rate i love the app but i cant use it because it just kills my battery pretty much everything else about the app is great though
98539,finally the full power flexibility and customization of the firefox browser has been brought to android firefox addons that increase privacy security and productivity now are possible on a mobile browser firefoxs code seems to have been optimized for android at last instead of a halfhearted port and the mobile fox is snappy and responsive  even with 23 addons installed the king is back long live firefox
99016,nice browser fast but its a bit of a battery hogger samsung have a feature call device core firefox according to device core uses 24 of the battery within 18 minutes samsung browser only uses 4 within the same time frame im definitely deleting this one
99268,pretty useless on my sgs plus the device gets stuck and hot living me the one option only taking out the battery uninstalled unfortunately
99640,adios fox sorry mozilla but after tollerating this app for a long time im removing it ff for android feels like its been abandoned in beta a real shame as i am losing the themes and the ad blocker which for me are the killer addons but i need a browser that doesnt run like a clockwork toy hola chrome edit having removed ff i note my battery lasts longer is firefox bad for the planet too
99901,ive used firefox for what 8 years or something  a long time pc i have no issues with but mozilla needs to up their game for mobile this drains my battery crashes constantly always freezing and losing my webpage switch to cm browser if you want a legitimate mobile browser
100131,drains battery quickerloads slower than chrome but has mobile addon support that chrome lacks has had a sloppy update in the past that disabled said addons but hopefully theyve learned to test more thoroughly now before pushing updates through
100288,one thing that needs to checked out is that the s10 is telling me firefox is a high user of battery strength
100670,downloaded to link to my pc but its too slow and drains the phone battery excessively switching back to chrome
100847,consuming more battery in my app list and downloading also too slow while comparing other browser
101120,the browser has everything you need except battery usage drains battery heavily compared to other browsers out there
101186,its an all around better option to power my personal network
101808,its a great browser but my phone constantly tells me that firefox is heavily draining my battery and i dont know why update seems like the issue has been fixed
102345,firefox isnt a very good browser like it should be but i dont want it to over power google or even any of its products so to speak and that all i got to say
102500,battery drainer sometimes tabs will go blank requiring a force stop im a big firefox supporter but the droid app news some major work i like the layout however and the ability to use addons
102939,firefox is a great browser for the computer but its very power hungry on the phone battery drains very fast even when not using firefox first time i installed it i noticed significant battery drain i uninstalled it and noticed the battery lasts longer reinstalled again and hardly used and battery life went down again
103598,i just love this app even if sometimes its slow firefox top three its like giving power to help the other apps work
104411,ive used firefox for many years on all my devices but of late this mobile version is causing issue on my phone as it will not close so runs constantly so my phone keeps complaining its draining my battery this also means it keeps the webpage last visited open so you cant go to home page i have tried reinstalling it but still the same which means i have no choice but to uninstall it to cut the battery drain its causing
104418,although it drains some battery speed is good no problems with opening multiple tabs on the downside shows some script errors on flash based pages and the worst part is that some sites like google superuser gmail do not open they show an error secerrorunknownissuer the worst part is that theres not enough information about this on mozilla support pages this wasnt expected
104467,im calling bs on the guy claiming the app drained 15 of the battery with four tabs running for 5 minutes mine has drained 1 in 7 minutes and it is still running in the background good browser with average battery drain looking forward to using this in place of chrome
104622,this app has had a memory leak bug for four years now and no sign it will ever get fixed after running this for three days it corrupts memory necessitating a system reboot on kitkat or many apps stop working or the system grinds to a halt on current operating systems it eats battery even when quit if you dont totally kill it page renders are great though just a shame it leaves so much junk running in ram
104734,seems to be draining power since the last 1 or 2 updates
104841,ive been using firefox for quite a while now but with the last couple of updates it has been very slow in loading up and it seems to really kill the battery on my lg g6
105556,this browser is great and the sync feature is also useful my only problem here is i noticed that this browser takes a lot of battery 935 of my power consumption for the last 12 hours  and i only used the app for half an hour
105698,firefox is a good browser and im sad to say but its unusable due to the battery i have a samsung galaxy s8 and close out my apps when im done using them out of 96 of my battery used throughout a day firefox was responsible for 38 of it even though its usage time was about 18 minutes
106365,very fast and way more battery efficient than google chrome
106444,i have used firefox on multiple platforms for many years the latest android version is accessing my camera at random points and causing excessive battery drain beware of this app
106500,helping me take power away from crooked browsers and overreaching technology thank you im in deep and you provide a big shovel
106673,best browser ever only down side is its way too white it would be awesome for a pure black version to save us some battery on amoled screens
106795,firefox is my go to inset browser works fine fails safe and drains to the bilges
106870,ublock origin on mobile need i say more well built in privacy mode disable autoplay videos except on youtube great speed performance and battery life moreover you are supporting a free and open internet
106878,i have used firefox for many years i consider it the most secure product on the market because it is constantly improving due to the dedication of their programmers who incidentally donate their time free of charge unlike other products that are governed by the almighty dollar
107142,finally a smoother scrolling effect but still not as smooth as in opera touch for users with amoled displays you can set it with an addon called dark background and light text to have a pitch black bacground on every website you visit very relaxing for eyes and battery friendly i wish we had this option implemented in browser appearance settings as a standard
107203,im enjoying this much more than the battery draining every move i make tracking chrome
107353,works pretty bad lately it drains battery really fast when in background for example it drained 43 of my battery in last 8 hours overnight my battery app monitor says audio was on for last 8 hours
107438,this is a disaster my battery was drained in a minutes and wont charge till i completely stop app app is great but problems with power wasting stopped me
107634,kaspersky battery saver shows firefox is always running may be even the good guys need to monetise to survive but why not do it openly why hide
108161,id give it 5 stars if it was lighter on system resources constantly getting the message that firefox is using an abnormal amount of resources and my battery drains so much faster with firefox compared to opera browser
108181,erases all the pages saved as pdfs when the history is erased thats a lot of work down the drain also no obvious way to change the download directory what garbage coding
108212,got tired of searching and running into ads with no ability to filter and so on mozilla gives you privacy control and customization addons only if you look for it but theyre great give you all the power and control to surf as you wishthank you
108218,this latest version 6401 is worse than the last last version started gobbling up battery and data for no clear reason this version simply wont connect or load pages four out of five times need to reboot phone each time to use it several other browsers on same phone have no issues android 810 on a samsung j327 going to be uninstalling
108278,it laggs it takes up battery and it is the best app ever
108300,only down side is that it drains battery other than that it is official
108357,slower than chrome and drains battery but because of addons its much better
108691,recently it is draining the battery when in use i have compared it to chrome using both for the same time and firefox used 21 double to chrome please fix
108724,i really enjoy using firefox when i change settings in firefox they stay changed the way i want them both of the other two major browsers have a tendency to every so often change my home page  search engine back to their preferences they frequently change my backup settings location settings etc i hate that firefox lets me be in charge of my browser i really appreciate that and it is extremely reliable and when a webpage with bad spot does crash my browser i find it easy to recovery the tabs i want to recover and only the tabs i want to recover excellent
108816,when zooming so i dont have to strain to read text it does not readjust the text to the window so i have to scroll from side to side seems a bit faster at loading pages than before but still slow and having to scroll side to side is unacceptable please get your act together on android i so want to use your browser but you continually fail it has been many years now why is this so difficult for your developers back to opera i go program is now over 300mb wow old reviewwow mozilla terribly disappointed i do not have the time to wait on your browser over the years i keep coming back but your browser continues to be terribly slow 174mb bloatware i gave firefox another try as i am a big supporter but when it falls so short on crucial things not on an under powered device or slow internet pages load slow on all my devices i cannot find a way to make pages load in the background i open a tab in the background and when i finally go to it then it starts to load what a joke developer suggestions were how i use my browser therefore no help very long time firefox user but this is unacceptable surprised you have space in mobile with this atrocious browser mozilla fail dolphin browser is so much faster i would rather be running firefox but the load speed is unacceptable i value my time more than that please dont fail me on desktop i am trying to hold on this is mobile therefore screen real estate is crucial but firefox has an unnecessarily giant address bar with tons of wasted space fail black background with whitegray text helps save power and reduce eye strain there is an add on but the page loads twiceoriginal then inverted colors which makes your slow program even slower reduce the size of your notawesome bar screen real estate is essential you should not have to be informed of this very disappointed with this product
108826,great browser for both pcandroid deviceit take reasonable memorypower and also no heating  hanging issue
109163,version 57 noticeably improved performance and battery life ui feels sort of cramped at times
109519,kept crashing ate up battery in the span of 2 hours
109895,had to delete using 40 of battery when not in use ive used firefox for 15 years now sad to have to delete it but switching to chrome til this is addressed
110199,i use only firefox some bugs sometimes i press the go button to browse to a website after typing a url and nothing happens until i close that tab and try with a new one today long pressing links only seems to highlight textcant open in a new tab the tab interface should have a faster way to switch sometimes android warns me that firefox is draining my battery
110217,works great most of the time my only complaint is when android system notifies me that firefox is draining my battery even though i prevented firefox from running as a background process this setting seems to have no effect
110287,overall nice app but battery consumed too much please fix it
110330,has been my default browser for years and i absolutely love it it integrates seamlessly with the system and gives me the power and freedom i have learned to expect from mozilla
110568,recently all my saved password lost i even didnt update it but problem happened also we cant export our bookmarks switched to chrome aslo consuming a lot of battery in background
110867,no movies 4 halloweenwants to charge me again againect thank you
110930,drains battery have to force close it all the time to stop draining the battery and even then in 10min it starts running in the background again draining more battery
110932,i love to use firefox whenever i watch my fav kdrama thanks firefox and more power
110960,i had it installed and it seemed ok then one of my antivirus apps told me it was draining my battery i uninstalled it and now my battery is lasting much longer between charges bye bye firefox
111361,everything is best just its draining battery a lot please fix this issue
111383,good browser but drains battery like mad become unusable after full charge without opening firefox app it drained 15 of battery in 15mins
111451,i have been using firefox for android nearly from the time it was introduced without problems and in the past it performed well but the last update resulted in extremely high battery drain  i usually operate in airplane mode and am able to run 45 days without a recharge  firefox now consumes 74 of battery power and battery life has plummeted 7585 even though android doesnt show it as an active app and the low battery warning sounds within 24 hours  ive manually stopped the application and disabled notifications to see if battery drain returns to normal  if it doesnt firefox will be gone for good from my device  this is something that should never ever have passed testing before deployment
111910,edit i will be getting an alternative to firefox soon since mozilla is reaching beyond strict user safety and going into destination censorship i will miss the greatness of firefox   more privacy more power over my own browsing bookmark importing and synching and encrypted password storage rock on mozilla rock on
112044,always liked firefox but something has changed this browser is basically unusable for me now its unbelievably slow top that off with it heating my phone up now and ive had to go a different route
112161,has been my go to browser on both mobile and desktop but something in a recent update has resulted in it draining my battery at a scary rate  eg today my phones been on battery for 12 hours firefox has been used for 2 mins and its 22 of battery use cant use it in its present state
112752,it is the best browser in android store but it drain to much ram memory
112780,i got a warning saying that firefox is using 113 of battery and needs to be stoppedput to sleep i never got such notification from chrome
112788,this is a decent alternative to chrome but i often have problems with the browser becoming unresponsive it just wont go forward or back a page and links wont load sometimes if it sits long enough pages will eventually load without any indication or load bar most times i have to restart the browser notifications also often get stuck and wont clear unless i force close the app the experience just feels unpolished and slow this may have marginally better battery life but chrome definitely loads pages with better site compatibility and performance i love firefox for desktop but this just doesnt cut it to be my mobile browser of choice
112807,actually its 45 star rating app but due to high battery usage rating decreased to 4 fix it otherwise its good app
112890,a better designed mobile web browser than google chrome supports extensions and also has more useful builtin functionality than chrome except for an apparent lack of support for autofilling payment info into forms via info stored in google pay i end up switching browsers when buying online selecting text is a disaster and takes way too much time to get right in firefox also browsing in firefox always seems to deplete my battery very quickly if firefox fixed its quirks on android the negatives mentioned above mainly it would easily become my fulltime browser i wish it could be for now it isnt as my battery life and patience is precious note also that unfortunately desktop firefoxs killer new privacy  security feature containers is missing from the android version 
113131,i love it its fast and good working the only bad thing is it take a lot of your battery
113232,my s4 came with chrome which is nice but sometimes goes crazy and drains my battery firefox is a great replacement that doesnt do this
113304,easily the best browser but the battery consumption is bad
113489,generally a good browser the only negative point for me is that it doesnt stay completely switched off even when i manually force stop it in the android apps settings given that firefox is rather large thats an issue for my small ram and also for my battery life
113605,make sure to add the adblocker ublock origin your phone battery and your brain will thank you
113628,it does not waste battery not runs in background just have my respect chrome is disabled
114592,firefox kept my phone awake 5 hours yesterday ran the battery dead uninstalling solved the problem
114712,loved it  great replacement for firetube to run youtube videos on background though it has a good impact on battery but still its awosome
115094,"its a best browser i have used ever their is no doubt about that even 
though am also facing some issues like while streaming videos online my 
device is heating up rapidly and also system pops a message that firefox 
browser is draining battery i hope u gays can fix"
115118,"keeps playing videos even after ive changed screens and wont stop unless 
i shut down firefox also using a lot of battery power lately"
115315,"i really like firefox but anytime i use this app my phone crashes 
overnight and my battery doesnt charge ive seen it at 100 and then less 
than an hour later it shuts off and the battery is at 32 id end up late 
to work because my alarm wouldnt go off because of it it was driving me 
crazy i didnt know what was causing it until i realized it was this app 
now that ive deleted it it hasnt happened since"
115806,"a lot of the issues that were present in the previous versions has finally 
been fixed  excessive ram hogging slow scrolling etc thanks to the 
developers for taking such stern actions however some issues are still to 
be improved firefoxs battery consumption and ram still has enough space 
for improvements to be made loading times are satisfactory but actually 
are higher than that of the other browsers as many are also suggesting 
the ability to have the address bar at the bottom would also be a delight 
i hope firefox android will be back to its former glory once these 
improvements are made"
115950,"need another device to use account everyone on the forum is rude and 
condescending towards people with questions cant change download 
location literally zero customer support im gonna go charge up my 
nintendo dsi because the stock nearly decade old opera browser on that is 
far better than this junk"
116397,"id like to give a better review i use firefox at home and love it 
however this app crashes all the time even when im using other apps it 
runs in the background and i get a popup that it has crashed it drains my 
battery in the background pretty severely and stops spotify while im 
browsing not sure what thats about also it loads even simple websites 
very slowly so its really not worth the headache right now running s8 
with nova homescreen"
116687,"would give 25 but cant do half stars battery drain usage is sporadic 
between versions and little care is given to preserving the user experience"
117070,drained 60 of my battery in an hour in background
117075,"dear firefox i am a samsung user so i kindly suggest you to add a black 
theme in your next update as i use firefox for long time i drains more 
battery for me"
117119,"the new quantum ideology is amazing light on ram  battery but for some 
reason basic functionality is bugged i have enabled clear private data 
on exit when i surf a little bit  try to exit the browser it takes ages 
to clear the data  the browser never quits i have to manually force stop 
the browser please fix this i would appreciate the option always private 
mode instead of clear private data on exit that would be great"
117345,"no way to import bookmarks from chrome thats dumb and ui is just not 
great small page and active buttons difficult to press doesnt recognise 
torrent files for downloading in utorrent lotsa little thingsand is now 
a resource hog and battery drain"
117526,"other than some layout differences some website rendered the desktop 
version instead of the mobile version some layout doesnt render quite 
right on some web site and feels just a tad sluggish compare to mobile 
chrome all is good i also noticed when using this browser it seems to 
use up more system resources ie cpu running a bit warmer use a bit 
more battery power than chrome"
117720,"very feature rich especially when using addons the options for privacy 
and security are better than any other mainstream browser now with the new 
rendering engine performance is also good still a bit more power hungry 
than chromium based browsers"
117884,"somehow it seems to be constantly draining battery i am not sure the 
reason for this but whenever i use firefox there is a massive battery 
drain"
118046,"the last few updates have definitely increased battery drain i almost 
always get a warning on my phone no tabs opened either"
118179,"32917 19 battery usage with just a few tabs open phone becomes hot 
during use gonna get cancer of the fingers from the extra radiation i 
guess firefox is an apt name maybe this app caused samsungs to catch 
fire  older versions made browsing erratic jumps from small to large 
font and back again unusable will have to uninstall  try another browser 
going forward"
118430,"slower than chrome but has adblocking capabilities drains your battery in 
30 mins i went from 90 to 30 it still collects data from you for crash 
reports so you can forget about privacy aspect the only you would need 
it is for adblocking"
118439,"too much power hog crashes often due to poor ram management the only 
reason i use it in my phone is to sync bookmarks with my desktop"
118533,"its pretty good well rounded browser and compared to previous versions 
much less of a battery hog only issues i have so far is i turned off 
search suggestions but it still offers suggestions and at times it appears 
that since i switched to firefox on my phone the phone will get fairly 
sluggish after awhile"
118571,"this app works very very well but it absolutely destroys your battery 
life i had an ad blocker with it as an extension so i can only assume that 
didnt help but my battery went from all day to 3 hours and now after 
uninstalling it its not dying anymore"
118577,"the best browser ive been using firefox in the last three years and i can 
really feel the heat in my eyes and fingers anybody should try this no 
regret"
119015,"please add a black status bar or a night mode i downgraded just for this 
because it messed up my notifications bar too so imunable to see battery 
time etcalso keeps crashing in mobile and pc  taking ages to loadit 
was the best browser now i had to switch to another on both pc and mobile 
i was trying to do online order and was constantly refreshing the payment 
pageand lots of more problems were to start sorry but not a trusted 
browser since last update"
119039,"soooo this browser i was pretty excited to download it since i have it 
on my pc but there was a problem or two battery life  cpu usage only 
very effective when watching videos of 30 seconds or more this post was 
made in 2017 of july and up to this point in time im still 
experiencing that problem"
119226,"latest updates has started to use more battery would run my phone down 
within 8 hours running dolphin browser now and tripled my battery life 
fix that and ill come back to ff"
119558,"overall very good but giving it a 1 star due to battery drain there is no 
point having a mobile browser which i have to manage individually due to 
its battery draining this is a known issue"
119681,a few days ago my battery was depleting faster than usual once i deleted firefox it proved that the app has been eating away my battery even though i closed it in the background i dont know why this is happening but until this problem is fixded im reluctant to reinstall
119766,unfortunately its unresponsive battery drainer quite outdated design i cant imagine how it came to have 44 rating
119820,latest version chewing the battery 50 percent drain in 4 hrs when not even using it stats show its by far the biggest battery hog was updated yesterday
119937,this latest version is killing my battery battery monitor shows 15 drain for 2 minutes of use
120098,for a low end phone 1 gb ram this app is very heavy on resources its slow and uses a lot of battery  if it was not for the add on s i wouldnt use it on android at all why doesnt mozilla spend some time on reducing the memory footprint
120193,my hauwei mate 8 mobile over heating while workingplz fix the issue
120604,this is browser very good but firefox quantum is only for computer and not for mobile please make firefox quantum for android because i hate yandex browser i need extensionsaddons and power but firefox not have power
120614,much slower than chrome and drains battery takes more memory than chrome
120805,the app is great havent had any problems with it  that sometimes it has high power usage when running in the background
120902,i know this browser is one of the best but a little difficult for me lg x charge
121116,i only use this because chrome mobile doesnt have addons lately firefox has been absolutely guzzling my battery using many times more battery than any other app on my phone even when im not using it at all hope this gets fixed soon or ill have to uninstall it
121568,the new feature form mozilla to firefox is attractivebut it kills battery power more than others
121759,theres a serious bug on my s8 the browser only shows a quarter of of the screen im pretty sure this only happens when im not in power saving mode my psm makes my resolution change so i assume thats the issue
121766,good browsing app but drains battery really quickly i was having to charge at least twice a day sometimes more switched to edge and now have battery to spare at the end of the day
121822,give up mozilla very very slow battery drainer youre way behind chrome and opera
121864,once opened and post closing i find the battery tanks heavily even while attempting to charge  is that the app or things hiding in it
122294,the install size could be smaller and it sucks more battery than chrome  good browser though
122609,its not upto the mark the top level totally white background  we could not able to see signal or time or battery indicators it covers everything  its annoying and also no night mode feature too
122671,painfully slow at loading web pages whereas previously this worked fine  plenty of available drive capacity and processing power on my device might be time to abandon firefox in favour of chrome dare i say it 
122819,keeps restarting and running in the background using battery  up
122974,if the developers fixed the choppy rough scrolling and fixed the issues with battery draining 510 every time i open a 40 second youtube video sometimes even mp4s posted to reddit do it this could easily be the best browser i love that i can install adblock extensions chrome really sucks for disallowing that but at least it doesnt drain my battery and jump all over the place when i scroll through pages firefox is just too rough it needs to be smoothed out
123086,i am surprised that the changelog doesnt seem to mention speed improvements which was my biggest gripe with the app before it will probably be my default browser now though i will be keeping an eye on battery usage
123942,froze lagged pretty much destroyed my phone  wouldnt let me click drained battery and reallyjust pissed me off
123981,this browser caused performance problems with my lg v20 like freezing lagging and battery drain  had to uninstall
124012,please optimize the battery life  can you guys add a feature of data saver like in google chrome
124095,this once awesome browser has become incredibly slow and energy draining and now i discover that i cant even select and copy text within a hyperlink i know this seems like a trivial gripe but its the little things that make or break our enjoyment of critically important frequently used apps
124293,big hype not enough juice its simply not fast certainly not faster than chrome also the x in the address bar does nothing it does not clear the current text and should probably be updated or removed the backgrounding of links is a nice feature
124454,just like always i download firefox mobile all excited about it it isnt chrome its awesome i use it faithfully for a few weeks and then the rot sets in it slows down dramatically it crashes randomly it wont load pages anymore just black it uses battery like the last one was made and none of them can be charged anymore i really get discouraged with this browser it could be great it isnt even good enough for meh right now
124604,stops responding  constantly need to power cycle to reset
124652,firefox is suddenly massively draining my battery the last i checked it used 96 even though i had hardly used it at all ive liked using firefox as my main browser but if this continues ill have to delete
124754,consumes too much battery lifeeven when in backgroundneed some work done on this problem
125496,not a good android browser  firefox quantum may be great in the pc but on android it drains battery like crazy
125555,this an awesome app but it takes away half my battery
125559,my preferred mobile browser however  im getting constant warnings from android oreo that firefox is draining my battery
125572,i have switched to firefox as my go to browser on pc but this app just absolutely killed my phone battery if they fix the massive battery drain id give it a 5 star rating
125614,the latest update sucks the interface is ugly and it chews up my battery like no tomorrow i dont want my android to look like an iphone if i wanted that i would buy a damned iphone
125631,why does this app keep running in the background even when youre not using it unnecessary battery drain uninstalled
125642,why is it in the updated version notification and status bar of phone look at blank and white i cant see time or battery status while browsing anymore fix it
125890,status bar at the top is complete white it hides all important details like mobile signal battery status and time
125910,i used to prefer firefox on my android before the last updates since then its been the cause of extremely severe battery drain my phone would go from full charge to nearly dead within 4 hours of complete nonuse which happened repeatedly with two different batteries aside from being aesthetically awful compared to the previous version its slower than chrome this version is a complete failure dont waste your time downloading it
125991,i got a battery drain warning on galaxy s6 edge 
126117,good browser but what a drain on battery light to moderate use was responsible for a full 30 of my battery life during a normal day in my pixel back to chrome i go i guess
126367,takes quite a long to load page status bar blends with the notification area making it impossible to see the battery pecentage or anything else and it is  quite heavy on system
126493,very good browser that is safe and fast but only downside is that it consumes lot of memory and battery firefox need to improve in that area
126503,crashes battery drain unauthorized background activity report made by phone company
126529,you should feed firefox before releasing it   unfortunately the new firefox is a total disappointment it ate 40 of my lg g5 battery in an idle period i used to prefer firefox to be my browser but you guys kept changing it to the worse actually ive started believing firefox uses my phone for hidden cryptocurrencies mining
126605,great browser but i get repeated warnings regarding battery usage hope this can be rectified soon
126617,congrats youre the only app ive had on this phone that i get constant warnings for power consumption on and thats when im not even using it and no refresh option from the default display seriously was hoping this would be an improvement but just more of the same awful gs8
126734,been using firefox since version 10 on the desktop over ten years ago and its still handsdown the best browser available on any platform its had its growing pains on android but sync works beautifully now scrolling is smooth as silk the ui is polished and intuitive and the clincher addon support on mobile a decade on and its still simultaneously easy to use and a power users dream the crown jewel of the open source community long live mozilla
126924,great new update quantum power in my phone lightning fast
126926,previous version has compatibility with addon quitnow current is not  would be very appreciated if developers makes modifications to be able install addon mentioned above otherwise firefox allways running and  consuming battery ram
126930,app was good but it drains battery more yesterday i check battery consumption android system was 984 and firefox 2560
127008,love the new design and logo simple clean design is great but now i cannot see my icon bar at the top off the screen the white colour washes out my battery and signal and clock and have tobclose the app to see it
127035,long time firefox user as default browser on both windows 10  android  its a welcome update smooth transition between tabs  seamless sync is the power of mozilla   all the best for your future endevour
127142,quick battery draining firefox drains my battery from 20 to 1 in almost 30 minutes where other browser only drains 68 percent other than that all good
127154,much better than before addons and themes on mobile is priceless also neat features in general there are a few things that i encountered that was slightly bothering me last pass accessibility just plain doesnt work and had to fiddle with the checkboxes to toggle them oh and battery consumption is noticeable but thats just based on feeling awesome browser
127339,a real upgrade at least for my phone it is im often wary of updating apps because of issues that often plague new versions but this one is true to its word its fast faster than my old ff version lighter less lag and surprisingly less taxing on my battery the only thing i didnt like was how the interface reminded me of google chrome but i guess thats small a compromise the pocket recommendations on the front page is a great addition too even if its repetitive if you use the pocket app itself lol also a little bugged by the twocolumn tiling of tabs instead of the previous long list it was other than that firefox is still the best
127480,battery drainer used over 1hr of battery in the background
127510,hi in the new update white colour status bar is not good it merges with time battery percentage network signal icons  the black status bar in incognito window is perfect and nice can u fix it plz
127536,since the new update to go along with the new firefox quantum the browser is a lot slower now and takes up a lot of battery til those issues get fixed itll be a 2 star in my eyes afterwards itll go back to a 4 star
127593,please add a quit option it consumes a lot of battery because it seems to run in the background thanks
127711,your new update is not standard update again then i give you 5 in my device when i use this browser new update i dont see my battery percentage  data speen and so on pls fix it
127978,new ui and miuixiaomi dont look great together makes the topbar white however all the text battery time icons remain white too cant see them while using ff  and guess what not using it now
128043,this new update is horrible white status bar prevents me from seeing notifications went from perfect to a glaring eyesore  edit  whoever is in charge of of app design needs to have there employment terminated this is the worse update ive ever seen
128184,after last update i cant see bar with time network and battery status i use miui 8 could you please fix it
128190,in the new update i cant see my phones network battery etc bar for this versions white backgroundvery disappointed after this new update can we change white background to black
128284,i really love the ui of the update but its burning through my battery ive used it on my pixel on screen 12 minutes today  im 26 battery down thats unacceptable please fix this asap i dont want to have to use another browser
128318,the only browser which makes my phone to get heat
128329,post nov 17 update ui is just ugly colour scheme choices are jarring and look straight outta the ms playbook  seriously pocket this again the option to turn it off is there its just not obvious i assume this is intended to stop folks turning this junk off also hung my phone on first start had to pull the battery
128339,best browser good performance and no hanging problem no battery killer alike other browsers
128406,my only issue with this last update is it made the screen this bright sterile white even on my lowest screen setting its still piercing please add an adjustment not only would less light be nicer for me  but it should also improve power usage slightly
128448,found it was draining my battery excessively and hated the new interface
128563,using firefox is easy and smooth i just dont know if i like the new aesthetics my phone burns things onto my screen pretty easy and im a bit wary of the white just noticed i cant see my battery percentage when im on it unless i get really close to the screen
129185,please just fix its battery use   i used it for 5 minutes and it used 2083 mah power
129220,used to be awesome now not at all constantly dumps ram on closing eats way too much ram and battery and can no longer move to sd firefox was my only browser now i need another thats not so resource heavy
129478,best one  want to improve ur battery life install and notice ur self
129702,using more memory space and huge battery draining apart from this it was good
129833,doesnt hangs like chrome or opera does improved battery life and  i can use n sync it in real time with laptop  also tention free for paswords it keep all of them secure with master password n sync too  with laptop  no bogus updates as chrome have n it is so simple to use  please improve more fluidity
129926,was told that you could download internet videos to your device  dont have the slightest idea how to make it do that   still cuts photos in half and stacks them on top of each other making a pdf wont copy all content to pdf  only 3 stars because my issues have not been addressed  will not shut off runs in the background and runs down your battery when making a pdf file it copies the top and bottom page controls and interfers with text makes making a pdf useless still cuts pics in two when making a pdf doesnt show arrow when making pdf  open tab shows for 12 second it makes pdf files with no content blank lovely
129957,one of the best app less resource consuming  doesnt drains battery
130058,firefox is better in battery use reader mode is amazing just try and you will find more things about it
130076,causes my tablet ngt5110 to start overheating within two minutes of opening firefox 560 i get the overheating warning and can feel the heat towards the bottom of my screen if i dont close ff the tablet restarts itself so frustrating
130164,i think you need to rethink the way you do things i have a problem with your system i tried to get some help with it from jackass who wants to charge me money just to tell me why your system is screwing up
130177,it works and is great on battery life but at the time of writing android had much better alternatives if you are married to the firefox account system for syncing bookmarks and such just stick with this one for convenience
130206,hello guys do the have the option of darkblack mode on firefox on android this will be a great battery saver for amoled screen users
130575,its trustful it consumes less battery n allow me to enjoy my service
130600,i regret giving this app such a negative review for this has been my go to for years but lately it has been showing so many signs of instability im not sure whats happening but firefox causes my phone to drain heat excessively and reboot nearly unusable i thought my phone was just about to die but i went back to using opera and i never had any issues even firefox focus is doing the same damn thing
130987,really improved version rolled out now able to view all videos without codec support ram and battery usage also good
131086,not good switched to firefox from chrome as chrome was draining battery firefox was a little better than chrome but the user experience is just not comparable to chromes in any way infact only after using firefox i realised how much better chrome is and maybe thats why the battery drain
131178,wow effective browserno more battery draining please improve page load performance
131338,even with a high end smartphone with plenty of power firefox just seems sluggish plus web pages are still a little slow to load and render i so want to like this app but you need to remove all the bloat features and return to a simple fast secure browser
131350,i love the desktop version but over the years this app version has become a burden to my phone since the last few updates it has been freezing and crashing on occassion and has become a big battery drain
131942,firefox used to be a great browser but now its not only a memory hog a battery killer it literally drains my battery so fast and when i go to look something up instead of going directly into firefox which is my main browser i have to touch the little black bar that comes up saying open in firefox ridiculous get it together you guys very poor quality too many megabytes each update too many updates as well
132031,keep slowed over the time are this app getting old than going to die upg this app drain your battery cell quickly 
132056,okay first things first firefox is a beast that guzzles battery i can go from 100 to 80 and lower in less than an hour my battery optimization apps try to shut it down all the time and even when im not using it it uses just as much battery sometimes ive clocked the memory usage at 1gb more than any app i have monitored saying that you get all the mod cons to be expected with firefox addons dedicated privacy features themes and a renowned familiar browsing experience and you get a browser from a company you can trust who are attempting to pioneer transparency in online privacy and have been championing the movement since time immemorial solid browser needs work though cant complain extensively though this is one of the best browsers out there with all its issues and bugs withstanding
132130,huge battery drain percentage compare with android system within 2 days firefox background process is terrible
132746,i absolutely love firefox its the only browser i use on my laptop or my phone the browser that came on the phone is a joke and chrome is slow as hell even if these things werent true the addons alone would make firefox worth using there are some amazing features with the addons i see the complaints others have but ive had no trouble at all it is true that it eats battery and thats definitely something that could be looked into to fix but i just downloaded some battery saver apps that boost the phone ram and problem solved i also really appreciate that firefox works to defend user privacy and is a nonprofit ill keep using it as long as these things remain true 
133184,uses too much battery and kept phone awake for 10 hours overnight
133298,im devoted firefox user over pc n checking out firefox android from past 2years but it still has many features missing n still not that easy going ui sync doesnt work clearing history is not one click method downloading is not that strong battery consumption is high sometimes it doesnt load images or videos present on page no option to watch videos in higher quality text rendering is still not superb still no customisation for ui as it looks too bland yes addons r big plus but basics r must
133316,way better than chrome in terms of ram cpu and battery consumption so you will  get faster speed longer sot and never overheat addons need refining but has the capabilities is a huge plus for productivity already
133401,some bugs power consumption is high like some of my apps still being available
133690,i was noticing constant battery drain and stopping firefox usage brought back battery life uninstalled it permanently albeit i used firefox since its first beta release in 2013 as no one cared about the reports
133865,it killed my battery on the first use it seemed to be operating when not in use
133906,firefox is still my favourite browser but it is unbearably slow in the last couple of months 082017 really whats going on to this once power browser 
134048,recently facing problem app is drawing too much power please fix the bug at earliest
134396,what happened i used to like this app a lot and i really like the trackmenot feature  the only problem i used to have was that the app would mysteriously disappear off my phone whenever i would restart it it happened on 3 separate occasions but i kept redownloading it because it was at least useable then however recently i have been getting swamped in ads and pop ups when ever i browse even though i am using the ad blocker extension also the fact that all videos are opened in a new browser window instead of playing on the current page is a huge inconvenience and causes even more lag  this used to be my go to browser and i would use it multiple times a day because i prefer using 1 app for most of my internet related tasks instead of using a browser facebook etc and killing my battery in a couple of hours i have switched back to my old browser opera because it runs much more smoothly in general
134446,meh   to be honest the only reason why i got this app in the first place is to play audio from youtube while on another tabapp or simply having the phone sleep this saving battery life you fixed it now it sucks plus its about as fast than a sloth on energy drinks no thanks
135129,it works well and has more customization and user freedom than most mobile browsers on the market making it one of the most powerful browsers available for phones  one feature that would really add to firefox for android would be the ability to manage bookmarks better like being able to move bookmarks and folders other than that androids version of firefox is a great choice for power users regular internet explorers and opensource enthusiasts on the go
135485,would like to like this but my god is it a battery drainer  set my phone down for almost two hours to watch a movie and came back to 18 battery remaining  this was with over 75 to start  love ff on the desktop but mobile needs major optimizing to be usable
135569,i love firefox and have used it for years on laptops the flexibility and relative security has been a big plus but fx on android has hardly ever worked without issues in the last couple of years it has been getting more resource hungry consuming ram and draining the battery it is now painfully slow sometimes becoming completely unresponsive sadly the time has come to say goodbye on android now using much faster brave
135829,great browser but is an absolute battery hog on my s7 edge im constantly receiving alerts for high battery usage never had this problem with chrome considering switching back
135973,laggy and when i power off my phone and start it up its deleted off my phone
136021,i really like this browser than any other but am facing a problem it drains my battery sometimes in background even i am not using
136435,uses quite a bit of  battery wants to run in the background all the time also it used to be fast it gets slower with every update now theres quite a few faster browsers available and no i dont have a lot of addons to slow it down its just slower test driving a replacement now
136457,i don t really like it because it makes my phone battery drowning
136514,give some reward points for browsing which can be used for recharge
136549,slow and laggy compared to chrome and also drains the battery
136577,the recent versions on numerous devices i have are so slow crash prone and overall make internet explorer on a pc look like a turbo charged cheetah over 1 tab and or slows down even more 3 tabs  yeah have fun with molasses
136601,massive battery drain its also done something to my signal keyboard uninstalled
136626,suddenly it overheats drains battery quick cpu intensive and is sluggish when in use
136707,its fast its smart and its safe the firefox browser does what it claims to do so im quite happy with that but i challenge you to find another app that drains as much battery as this one when it plays video it might not just be with video but nevertheless when an app makes my phone discharge while it is being charged theres a problem not to mention the apps inability to play and 1080p video i like and it would be a lot better if it didnt have all these problems so please fix it
136756,wont load pages crashes and drains my battery in 10 minutes
137015,continual freezing slow operation laggy excessive battery usage and blurred text mean i can only give one star this is the same on a sony xperia z5 samsung galaxy s5 and samsung galaxy s7 complete utter rubbish uninstalled
137471,firefox is a good browserafter using on pc luv to use it on phone thanks thanks to mozilla community for mozilla on android keep the power of open source going
137675,i love firefox but lately its been eating up resources and killing my battery life
137684,unfortunately it now seem to eat up battery use and heats up my s7 edge  fair well old friend it seem that the firefox team are unaware of all the growing low scores that too bad
137793,it wouldnt be so bad if it would shut off or uninstall but it does neither just kills my battery and constantly hangs  laughs especially on the private brozer that wont go away either i hate it but thats my taste others may not have the same experience with it that i do
137840,experience a fast smart and personal web firefox is the independent peoplefirst browser made by mozilla voted the most trusted internet company for privacy upgrade today and join hundreds of millions who depend on firefox for a more personal browsing experience  fast smart yours firefox is made with you in mind and gives you the power to take back control of your web experience thats why we design the product with smart features that take the guesswork out of browsing  search intelligently  ge
138522,in all honesty as much as this browser is bearable on an i7 its absolute rubbish on android drains battery faster than the screen also about 68 times slower than puffin browser
138831,its too much slow than chromeuse allot battery nd very slowi switched it desktop site but its nt good as chrome is
138949,stupid been searching for too long after clicking never remember there is no way to undo this even downloading third party attachments cannot fix wasting time reading post after post step after step one wrong tutorial after another firefox can be stupid and broken it is annoying reading post after post for something so little and every bit of advice is wrong because firefox android is different from firefox   unable to tell if it is better on battery
139564,ok im using firefox on my galaxy s4 only because its synced with pcs bookmarks and history as for performance lm not satisfied integrated browser is much faster than this when using 3g browser is consuming too much power im using firefox on my pc though and im pretty happy with it
139768,ive recently changed from chrome to firefox due to high power consumption from chrome and firefox doesnt drain somuch but it is very slow and laggy on samsung s6 plus please fix this issue as im not the only one with this same problem
139947,there is a problem with cache and cookies it is not connected to the wifi because i tried to log in with chrome at the airport charles de gaulle in paris there is a sign in after 2 checkboxes and after clicking a button after checking both website reloads leaving one checkbox unchecked i switched to chrome and everything works like charm as for tabs if my phone is the normal way vertical there is no space imagine working on sony e2303 alot of people have the same problem you should make tabs horizontally on the left screen so it slides from left side like cairodock does in linux mint with the ability to make your own icons on it and especially with new design making a switch from dark to light design to spare battery is also a good thing to do also there is a problem with syncing data i am logged in at the computer my tabs show up but at the mobile because there are no tabs they are in some list i need to click onmake tabs it will solve alot of problems also the themes i choose the one thats very dark because i lov dark why the hell you put transparent thing on every theme i cannot switch it off in any setting menu as i have small internal card and big xternal one the ability to download files to the card should be default one without using aboutconfig solution like showed at google it downloads to the card but not alot of people know how to do it especially if they arent programist or hackers like me the interface should be intuitive and well space designed maybe you the designers should take example from another well intuitively designed software called fruit loop mobile there they were able to construct multiple windows sliding on and off under buttons from manu sides that would make firefox revolutionary because all is about open source free access to knowledge applications right and if i need to switch applications insteae on working only in firefox then you failed and i dont have full access and skills to do it for you neither the time necessary if they can do it you can do it too good luck we are waiting for changes because we dont like using chrome from monopolist microsoft
140000,used to be able to minimize the app to save battery now i guess they took it off probably to monopolize youtube even more
140306,theres clearly a bug it takes 8 seconds or more before starting charging a web page i think im gonna uninstall it if clearing cache or data doesnt give nothing
140371,fwiw im also using ff sync and ive read other people mentioning thats what causes the drain
140397,still best browser  1 for losing the ability to play music and video while screen is off was such a nice feature to save battery and be entertained
140496,it sucks this version uses way to much data i use to like firefox ill try the beta version and see how my data works and if it drains it like this version im done with firefox
140507,love that its open source and sync with desktop is great but kills my battery so quickly compared to chrome
140610,the safest mobile browser  with addons such as norton safe search and adblocker i feel more secure previously ad popup redirected me to dangerous paid services which even if i cancelled or closed charged money from my service provider cant thank enough the developers
140666,i can play youtube videos in the background without having to pay 999 a month so 5 stars edit thats changed since google is dead set on charging 10 a month a feature that should be free
140759,i loved firefox for its ability to continue to play media files esp youtube in the background while i did other stuff or turned my phone screen off to save power now that feature has been removed and i will be switching to chrome and leaving my review at 2 stars until this problem is fixed back to the way it was
140969,used to be good for playing youtube in the background until they released a fix for it i no longer have a purpose for this app as it eats too much ram and my battery life would be worth it though if you could still play youtube in background going to 3rd party app 
141354,far too slow and laggy feels like theres a massive memory drain isnt as clean as could be compared to chrome browser
141602,guys what hpnd with youtube i notice if im power off my screenpaused the songs stops pls make it work again 
141627,its a really good app but it drains your battery like crazy if you could fix that or tell me how to it would be all 5 stars
