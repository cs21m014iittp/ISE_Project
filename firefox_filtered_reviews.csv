40 of my battery was used in 12 hours  no single app on my phone or a group of them uses that much  it says firefox used 40 of the battery since last charge 12 hours ago under restricted mode this is not good and probably have to force stop anytime im not using it to save my battery  
promote all you want with turning red but the browser is still bad battery usage is still one of the highest amongst available browsers i guess not listening to feedback is also a skill
almost awesome still for some reason no matter how many plugins i use or dont use pages still stall when they are a quarter loaded just sits there for a while then finishes loading every page every time on all devices i tested on atleast 6 phones and tablets all battery restricted settings off etc etc still gonna use it but its anoyying great product otherwise
the background battery drain is baaaaad ive been using firefox on android never had much of an issue but in recent weeks ive found that firefox is eating through my battery more than any other app on my phone and i watch youtube for more hours per day than i do firefox this is a sign of an issue beyond my control i have disabled background data access closed all open tabs for now i am switching to beta to see if that helps
animations waste a lot of time please add an option to turn them off one animation may be less than a second but if you use the app a lot of time those microseconds add up sheer waste of time plus it uses more cpu power sheer waste of cpu power
theres a bug only with firefox whenever i put my samsung phone into maximum power saving mode it limits apps so you can add a select few to your home screen when i add firefox it works fine but when i edit the layout to remove or add a new app firefox disappears so i have to stop and resume power saving mode just for it to reappear from the available apps i can add this only happens to firefox
absolute trash why on earth would you want to store payment info please fix how much data is used  please sort out the bookmarks bookmarks are not user friendly at all it needs to remember your last location in bookmark folders instead of having to go through then again to get to where you just were difficult to access saved logins  get back to the page you were on i dont allow this to use battery in the background yet it still does  cant reorder top sites
yes fancy giving me my 100 back google stole when paid a charge surprised did not show up on your dodgy account
better than google the battery draining invasivein your business corporation hog
just the fact that its battery consumption is so less compared to chromium based browsers it deserves a 5 star and its good
works correctly every time privacy settable to all my specs doesnt eatup my data or battery
unusable on samsung galaxy phones since 2021 major update fenix big fan of the app but after months of struggling it is ending up in the bin hello duck duck basically every time you leave firefox to use a 2fa app copy content from another app validate a payment in your bank app  and come back to it 3 seconds after all the tabs are reloaded and the current state is lost all battery optimisation settings set in favor of the app though
firefox browser mozilla firefox includes any search engine possibilities but is sleeker way faster than any other choices every time one vital i couldnt do without created by users for users corporate greed really is a pitiful option to adhere to instead of android operating system firefox dexterity and equally customisable power to the people that arent so daft to achieve a dexterity of device in smartphone
is using too much battery is top 1 on my cell without too much use i had to limit the background battery usage
just works seems recently doesnt even eat too much battery
drains a ton of battery on my phone running android 12
desktop app has gotten worse for data collection thunderbird refuses to implement user requested features from 10 year old enhancement bugs memory leaks mobile version eats battery unless prevented from running in the background mozilla brain drain due to social justice politics
i prefer firefox over all other browsers 3ven if it might take more processing power to handle it is the only truly stable browser out there right now
allegedly awesome but has serious problems whats new tab doesnt give accurate info cant change wallpaper if neither option exists ff logo doesnt work  customize home has no such option also dark theme inop for most websites cant drag  reorder bookmarks to make them easier to find to delete browsing data you have to choose quit every time you exit or use private mode often has problems loading pages and battery drain is no better than samsung internet why bother
i cant close any tabs without the whole app crashing if i manage to close some they reappear app will crash randomly without closing tabs cleared my cache didnt charge anything
battery consumption wise i belive this is the worst browser i love firefox but the increasing battery consumption makes me want to quit it
why did they charge android firefox because people who use their beta version said so not the 99 of users who use the standard firefox then they say its the user who wanted it 
mozilla firefox has been my favorite browser since netscape on android however they have some problems android devices say they are using too much battery when private mode is enabled and left on they have the same complaint about fairemail so im more inclined to believe this is just aggression against all open source apps firefox is their biggest browser competitor which is not based on chrome i have had similar problems with dolphin on android keep up the good work guys
20220217 how can i print from mobile browser this feature is no included 2016 no complaints this browser is set to my default browser on my s3 i  it that much my primary browser on my desktop pc and now on my mobile and even at work i use it now that we have access to use the browser i like the add on feature of quit button so u know its not ru ming in the background using up data in ur cell plan
i used to love the app until the last update the browser hides the android buttons for back and home along the bottom of my screen and the time signal and battery icons along the top screen change it so you have the option of setting your custom settings to not having to swipe down to back up i dont need another quarter inch of screen space i would much rather be able to back up or go to menu in a single motion or i dont know be able to see if i am still connected to the internet
updates w features seem to cause problems that never shouldve got off the drawing board but the ability to watch youtube videos without ads using addons earns them a 355 despite becoming increasingly battery hungry too bad they have to compete with brave or theyd win but sorry brave is a better mobile browser
firefox my beloved faster than chrome and easier on my battery while respecting my privacy and user autonomy at the same time
now my back and home buttons along with clock and battery status disappear unless you swipe on the top or bottom of the screen what a pain in the rear to use the back button on my s21 completely ruined the browsing experience i want my factory samsung navigation buttons back
almost satisfactory needs drag down to refresh for ease of checking that web page is properly loaded also you need to fix the issue with losing all private tabs if battery dies and phone shuts off
firefox now removes the buttons from android and operates in a full screen mode making it so you cant read the time or see your battery nor can you easily access the home back and index buttons i dont know if this is a new feature or a new bug but it makes using the browser more of a hassle than a convenience
best for yahoo mail and news ads dont lockit not great on youtube streaming so i test them all cant scroll in chromebook files and no printer support hp drivers are windows and on dvd chrome saves battery life by ssd and no dvd usb only keep up the great work
need fullscreen option to hide phone clock and battery bar
good app works perfectly but its a big battery eater
i love firefox always install it on any new device with big screen moto power 200 is major display love i use collection feature to capture brain storm activity or wiki boondoggle in math space
firefox is one of our last dogs in the open and free internet fight power to them
yea firefox is not censored dont be fooled by the incessant cons eminating from our controllersthe fewthe world economic forumie hadesgates rockafella etc now is our last chance to save humanity as we know it before 5g begins to control minds  bodies look up spacex in boca chica tx is rapidly sending up 5g satellites while cell phone companies are hurriedly installing 5g towers connectivity to occur thru nano tech in cvid vax everyone must resist this global seizure by few
sad aboutconfig isnt available to power users or for that matter any firefox user on mobile its not the same as firefox even though the desktop app shares its name with this one
it has a nice and easy ui but it consumes a lot of battery compared to chrome  opera it takes even a handful of space space is manageable but not battery please look into it one more piece of advice download sections can be disintegrated into filesimagesaudios etc
i use google for everything up until my pixel 4 battery stopped charging after a month of use and a little tiny crack on the back of my phone between the camera and the top voids my warranty and im just sol so i switched the tmobile got a galaxy s21 thanks google been a little customer still will be just one by your phones
still no history search drained 60 battery overnight still the only viable alternative to chrome  im developing stockholm syndrome
i used to rate firefox as a 5 star browser but it has become a battery drain over the last week today it used over 50 of the battery for 15 minutes of active use
battery drain when compared to chrome standalone adblocker is really bad
i dont know why but firefox has been using a large amount of battery since the last update please fix it
developers this is the browser that doesnt allow peeps to track  jack the most personal info and use it to their advantage and charge my credit card and give me bad bad credit and fraud case open up on them cause of being stupid cause one this app is private and i constantly check on everything since my data breach on frecking google  google chrome
i cant use that garbage super slow wastes your time and makes your battery to die faster becase you spend more time on what you are looking for
drain every one of the accounts my money keeps going into just drain it get the hands on the bastards that are completely stealing my money just take out their families taking out cold every man man child
firefox always surprises me with new addons bells and whistles i had to get a new cell phone im not tech savvy but firefox made it so easy to set up with my everything
omg i have had such a hard time finding browser that not for the truth firefox also hides the things they dont want you to see or hearkevin hart was on shark tankwhy would they put him on air when everyone knows what lies n crimes he is charged for but when i wrote n asked things on firefox i was taken for a ride they hide the actors behavior alsouninstalling
didnt receive order and someone charged my bank account an extra 6900its n disputefrauded
awfully resource hogging browser thats constantly draining the cpu forcing it to be flushed from memory by the os and losing my session also extremely buggy and not able to render banners and other web elements correctly on top of this it opts you in by default into running mozillas studies on your phone whatever that means and sends them your usage data
opportunity to join hands with immortal spirituality divine power and lasting religious amalgamation
new version still uses 20 battery on idle still has battery drain issues
a to z below info my account fill system reviews learn device 5000 par secouns  a power niternat info view
i have always loved firefox and the mozilla browser since day 1 and the mobile app is quality as always its just superior to all the others especially the native browsers on cell phones lol firefox is great particularly because of the extensions an adblocker will save your life if you ever watch youtube on your phone trust me youll never go back
extremly good browser with adblocker a major drawback is that it consumes a vast amount of battery
i cant recover my account as i am not able to get keys neither on my cell or on my mail
firefox is the only best choice for me but it getting slowdown the memory and draining battery percentage if i loaded plenty browser tabs
i like that this browser doesnt try to hijack your phone and wont start acquiring all of your personal data all of your contact info etc its very clean clear  has precision its not a power hog it doesnt consume all my bandwidth  i can integrate it as much or as little as i want between devices location and even over time lastly you can tell that its not cluttered with a few million lines of code
needs a lot of update to get it working the same as old versionalso keep on getting battery warning fire fox not closing down how to shut of fire fox when not usingexit doesnt do itupdate i cant copy and pastlatest march update now firefox constantly crashing crash crash crash crash crashwelcome to crash foxcos thats all it doesmarch 20 updatetime for the bin updatewhy cant you fix itasap pleaseso many updates and yet firfox keeps crashing on ebay login
app is ok needs work on power management and ram usage it takes a while to stop the app entirely too
i have added 1 additional star and i feel most of the previous issues that i had posted about like battery drain but for addons and securenot invisible are strong patrick
seriously whats not to love about firefox granted it doesnt have all the plugins it used to but it still has enough stopping power for bad stuff is it possible to have malware etc creep in yes but thats any browser and ff is far better for you than chrome or edge adopt ff pls for your own privacy
feature still missing as of dec 2021  keyword search support  tablet interface that is not just mobile  keyboard shortcuts ctrll to focus omnibar ctrlt for new tab etc please address these concerns for power users i understand that they are not the main concern but they made ff an inferior browsing experience with their removal keyword search and keyboard shortcuts wouldnt even require rewriting an entire gui ks is just a basic string substitution
installed looking for more privacy but found the unopened app was draining my battery 37 in a few hours what are they running during the idle very suspicious uninstall
stop removing features and generally getting in the way of power users give me access to the certificate manager so i can add my enterprise roots
way to many ads after update try reading news with low signal and youll see that it is so annoying i usually just give up and close the app and it uses more of my data  battery now
so far the experience blows neither the app on my phone or my fire stick will keep me logged in only person using it i get nothing but spins on my phone app to where it gave me a timed out error with a non working contact us link the user interface is just a giant box for each show nothing really attractive about it so theyre charging 899 for an app that looks like it was designed by a 4 yer old and it wont even open on my phone nice
still a good browser over all others for 2021 does all the needs for everyday people and power users
not what i remember from past installs and i was disappointed to see you integrated so much for the security of my cell phone that stuff you seem to have taken over
i prefer this a lot more over chromiumbased browsers it seems to use a little bit less battery when browsing although some sites still cause firefox to crash i have gotten use to the tab structure and menus and they arent as bad as the knee jerk angry reviews make it seem the bookmarks and password sync is easy to use even if the email with my authentication code took 20 minutes to receive its better than chromiumbased stuff in some ways and worse in some ways its a lateral move overall with the defining motivation being preference i prefer how firefox does things and i enjoy the slightly less battery usasge so im sticking with firefox
greatest browser feeling very safe when i use it also it gives me the option to choose my search engine so i can enjoy the power of google combined with high safety and extensive functionality of firefox
very good app for browsing the web on cell phone syncs with browser on desktop
more than a gigabyte of a browser 18gb  always  runs drains  battery after i quit from it every single time its get an update its become slover  by a bit bookmarks  are terrible mess and i forget mention the terrible looking new logo 
literally the best browser full stop tabs and switching between is on point i imagine this format will get copied the fastest load time ive come across and lowest power draw best part tho besides mad speed is the sync with desktop or other devices open and view tabs anywhere yes sir you rock mozilla do not go anywhere 
what happened to addons no search bar in addons user interface bad edit there are a lot of popups redirects from websites in spite of addons the addons it seems are not doing what they are supposed to do with every update u r going downhill takes up lots of memory battery spacesize of app the whole experience of firefox is poor what is fill link from clipboard 12000 in the latest version
use for an hr returned and still charging 2 weeks later
i really dont like firefox for these reasons first i dont like when i get rid of all of the places ive gone to on my cell phone and i delete the history one page always comes up and will not be deleted no matter how many times i tried to and when im waiting for a web page to load i have to look at the bottom and i just dont like the overall of it it isnt as good as google chrome but you cant use google chrome because it was gathering your information so now im stuck with this app
this app is good and its free so you can easily download it if you want to its your opinion to not mine or anybody elses and sometimes its glitchy if your networkwifi isnt working well but yeah thats pretty much it so enjoy searching in the search box and you can turn it into dark theme if you want because its better for your battery life to last long enough while your watching your favourite shows or anime on there and if you wanted english dubbed you can use this browser wco tv 
stop updating stop adding new features stop changing my settings leave everything alone until the heat death of the universe
compability with some sites is a bit of an issue so i had to change to bromite but still the ui minimal battery impact and functionality is unmatched
can be energy drain for celphone if we let firefox on this why i re move 1 star but firefox is the most secure internet browser
works but vastly inferior to its desktop version tab management is inconvenient no keyboard shortcut support mo controller support and uses a lot of battery youre better off using google chrome
im happy that you guys fixed a bunch of the things that i had mentioned before but it still has some ways to go before it gets back to its former glory one of the biggest things to fix is the addonsi suggest doing a survey before you lose more users whoever is in charge of the update path needs to be on the same page as the fans
by far my favorite mobile browser good ad blockers doesnt hog battery good ui
firefox is run by hackers that should die most painfully and slowly they are all a bunch of filth that do bad thibs which i can point out also someone get this to the ones in charge they will b dying within a few years
works ok but why in the world is it draining my battery like crazy android said it needed to stop ddain of my battery because of one app and its firefox wont be using it any more because of this also new tabs dont automatically get selected i have to quickly tap on open now or go to the menu to switch to the tab i just opened apparently im the only person who wants to automatically go to newly opened tabs
after the recent updateit seems to drain more battery in my deviceandroid 10
im a big fan of this browser the foundation behind it and it taking a stand against tracking but why does the phone in the screenshots here only have 14 and 6 battery remaining 
honestly it works really well and the ui is superintuitive but heres the problem i usually only have to charge my phone once per day with firefox installed no addons normal settings i basically have to keep a mobile charger tethered to my phone
very very power full  thanks for this unique app
divide this extremely powerful and very useful especially when it comes to encrypting your data with end to end encryption how ever i am still noticing account brieaches consistent information links would like to request permission for security enhancement higher security protection builtin scam artist and hackers have found various wayes with even more power for cyber attacks
139 drained in roughly 45 minutes thats with background data and such turned off its always been high in terms of battery consumption but 139 is just downright absurd
im amarjit singh is requeste to request please support me a collection payment and other products available in the my project ideas formula for may be new power generation energy project plusen controal fule saving project is all would like project is making a your support depends things please may have a collection payment is supporte please
please switch to firefox and help end googles monopoly over internet browsing yes google has a monopoly over our web browsing the majority of people use chrome as their browser and most other browsers microsoft edge brave browser etc are chromium based so they also rely on googles code mozillas firefox is the only true competition mozilla is a nonprofit organization with an a track record for advocating for our internet privacyrights support them google has too much power now
why does firefox used more battery by simply turning background battery it makes no sense i sometimes open firefox to read on thing and when i noticed my battery drains quickly is caused by firefox using 30 to 40 by used for literally 3 minutes it is frustrating
all the updates constant tinkering have made firefox very power hungry so it crashes often ive gone back to chrome  which just works
constantly closes itself and refreshes any open page i leave it on when it doesnt which uses up unnecessary amounts of data and power
so i like it but i have only installed it a gone thru settings on a cell phone thats why only 3 stars will update this later
aboutconfig is gone for literally no reason basic settings like setting desktop mode by default on a tablet or even a desktop interface instead of the mobile one are missing probably decent on mobile but trash on a tablet support even seems condescending on this matter i hate it when companies take away user power and control in exchange for some nebulous level of accessibility usually these very same companies try to minimize information density so that even a monkey can use it
i cannot access the saved collections on my cell phone
upon attempting to upload or update any previous version of firefox i always get the messgae you dont have any divices really im on it and trying to upload the latest outdated verson of firefox right now how the heck do i get the firefox application to see or recognize my divice  being my cell phone that im on
overall quite stablethe synced tabs feature is very useful for viewing my desktop tabs on the go it is also compatible with the firefox quantum desktop addons ublock origin on an android phone is awesome my only gripe is that firefox on android can be a bit heavy on battery usage
im not a power user but it has all i need
it was a good app but absolutely destroyed my battery my battery went from 3 days of use all day to less than a day and it is 100 because of firefox i had to get rid of it but i had no other complaints with it but its such a big one i have to rate it 2 stars
best web browser you can get for android and for gnulinux and windows especially when you add ublock origin to filter energy wasting ads it will improve your battery life and save a lot of bandwidth free and open source easy to use thank you mozilla and all contributors for this great work
it was good but like all good things the dictatorship bought it so they can use it to bully its users into surrendering their privacy so it can strengthen its authoritarian power against political opponents
the new update is good with better ui and some features but its main function that is browsing has become slow a bit and makes my phone heat up even more than when i use youtube its a great browser for privacy and stuff but please fix this asap
its almost the perfect browser with only one glitch i would truly appreciate the addition of an addon that allowed delete history on closing a lifesaver on my pc but a death trap on my cell please give us this addon please
amazing browser in terms of customization addons make it ideal for a power user it used to be my main but i moved to opera because frankly firefox is very very stuttery and cant maintain consistent performance when multitasking or even when running basic tasks
r ally working great and so much less battery usage than all others ive tried however print links dont work properly if you want to print a site as a pdf
i think you forgot to remove the share option it definitely leaves to much power in the user hands love how printsave directly or by means of extensions is missing and how exporting bookmarks is allowed only through an account keep fixing stuff guys
new update is causing battery drain issues even when im not using the app the whole day it uses upto 30 of my battery
ublock  background play fix thats what i use i have a job listening to audio through their browser 8 hours a day dozens of times a day i need to pull phone out see a reload  find my place in 2hr videowebpages crash multiple times an hour  i need to open  find my place ill push play hit power phone in pocket and literally 20 seconds later audio stops phone out open everything reloads because it crashed firefox needs competition hate dealing with this firefox mobile is broken
mobile are so heating and so fast charging is down
so far the best browser out there great addons and power efficient
havent updated for about a year and checked the current version on a second phone  no thanks i will stay with the old version the new version lacks many addons the tabbar aboutconfig and i dont know what else  this is already more than enough to use the old version mozilla makes the same downgraded updates with the android version like they did with the desktop versions but which company doesnt as a power user i want the software to be used and look the way i like but this is more and more impossible being forced to use old and maybe unsecure versions which not only often have more features but often also a better ui
latest version causes extreme cpu use makes phone drastically heat up and drains the battery of my android 11 phone just typing this paragraph used 3 of battery this is with all addons disabled other browsers chrome  duckgo do not exhibit this effect needless to say this renders it unusable too bad because firefox was my go to browser on android on windows desktop its still my favorite
why the hell are bookmarks hidden now just put them back on the menu dammit or at least give us the option damned cell phone driven developers so now july 2021 your latest update just crashes when i try to open it goodbye firefox i am done and going to chrome you clearly dont want users
its great especially adblocker but the issue is with streaming sites its not well optimised at least not as chrome  uses more battery  also navigation guesture sucks new tabs are pane and cant perform slide guesture to change tabs
the new geckoview based browser has been heating up my phone and constantly crashing or acting strange after opening too many tabs tab list blank control widgets disappearing ever since it was released last year im sure its amazing on current phones but its an absolute hog on my 2014 note4 hate to be forced to another browser but its currently unusable for me
not pleased with the last update disabling all my addons thats just a power grab had i known that i would have kept the old version shame on mozilla update for update no change had to go back to v68 fix the lack of addon support and the address bar location
a very good browser fast using it on my desktop and just recently installed on my android cell phone its superior by far compared to chrome
on a pixel 3xllatest os build as of 7621 phone became unstable battery draining and phone would reboot randomly even with 75 or higher battery charge uninstalled and have had zero issues since back to chrome i go
i watch yt videos on firefox due to background playback support but due to some reason the video stops when i reload the firefox the tab refreshes and loads this is so frustrating please fix asap i dont have settings like battery saver on
awesome for battery but there is a lot to improve compared to chrome firefox lacks the smoothness there is no copy image to clipboard no home screen button the auto hiding of url bar is choppy for most of the times but firefox is very light on battery hoping firefox will fix the problems in the future so sticking to it for sometime
ok but drains battery very annoying when it drops back into the default loading page instead of scrolling back to a previous page chrome and opera perform much better on android
app killed my battery over night in background very clunky ui mobile web surfing is such garbage in 2021
i was hacked and lost everything including visa breach was due to lack of protection which has been traced to a firefox problem bank notified me thank god but now im waiting for replacement cards and am imho all my accts payable want my hide until they can get paid everything was online as im 75 bed bound and have copd how can i leave to get to an atm verify new card if still have phone acct and ill be charged late fees on social security minimum income would you be mad
ublock origin is the best adblocker for mobile web browsers it saves data and battery it works great with firefox and you should install it from firefoxs extensions list once you install firefox
very very absolutely fantastic  power versatile websites browser with longerterm history of browser  browsers for fightings covid19 viruses disasters pandemics
insanely better than chrome doesnt harvest my data doesnt drain my battery and it feels more refined and human centric
itswell its firefox so ofc its the best but when it comes to the sync especially the open tab syncing feature it does fall behind for power users like me such a feature is very important and it makes me question myself should i even use firefox cuz it feels lacking i do not know about the iphone version as i own only android phones but yeh if the devs fix this problem then it would truly be the best
slow rendering pages content jumps around both while loading and when some page elements refresh and battery life halved system reported ff consuming more than system itself update no pages open system claims it used 88 battery in the past 8 hours
who are you to question my browsing you are not my cell carrier so what i do a lot of searching or movie hopping i do not get a internet connection through or from you
killing my battery by staying as a foreground task constantly unless i swipe it away in recents after each time im finished using it shame as i love firefox run as foreground task is being asked for and abused by so many apps now and theres no way of denying this permission though im sure its a bug in the case of firefox
my go tovbrowser when i need independance from google or cell mfgs
i will rate 5 star if you provide a option save as this browser also sucks a lot of power
battery usage is still a little high but this is a fantastic browser
the new tab interface still sux for quick tab changing for power users like myself the missing tabs were a dealbreaker way less efficient to switch tabs now i went to using brave as although slower still more efficient on my tablet to swap between 47 tabs
the video playback needs to improveit lags sometimes and it needs to be more power efficient rest of the things are very good
if i could give zero star i would once a featurerich browser now just a chrome lookalike removing features left and right and saying only 10k used it only 20k used it in the past month you have any idea those little by little groups you are annoying you are loosing your most dedicated users new people dont stick with firefox they go for chrome we are the one you get but no more i used to love firefox and what it stands for power users now both android and pc is just another chrome
i strongly feel that firefox has that fire which can burn up the monopoly of chrome and the browsers based on chromium and the way they juice out their benefits from innocent users like uskeep the fire burning and let it swallow everything
loving it moved away from ms edge after realising it was using 1 battery for every minute of browsing battery lasts all day again now
for my needs it wasnt the greatest idea when i downloaded it i dont feel that safe online protectiom that my search engine provides me i prefer it when my search engine is already programed to keep me and my cell phone from harmful virisis and the such
may 2021 update still no feature parity with v68 condensed original review if it aint broke dont fix it why are so many feautures removed much functionality  practicality has been lost in the name of design give power users choice and better customisation options ultimately feels like 1 step forward 2 steps back
i love using this website it helps me with a lot of stuff and and everything and locks out a lot of junk you dont want i try i always use firefox and everything on my systems and my cell phones
frustrating as of late everything that was good about firefox is gone its just like every browser on the market now they took steps to limit power users nothing is intuitive have to go through multiple menus for anything wont play in the background addons are limited videos refuse to play and needs constant restart brave browser is a better alternative than this mess of an app youre losing users and deserve it
not ready for the mobile market and power users can easily get bogged down by open tabs has this absolutely utterly annoying feature where if you swipe on a fullscreen video it switches to the next tab who the hell thought this was a great idea whos the damn genius who came up with this i cant even comprehend it swiping to switch tabs lmao braindead dev
so far its pretty good  i thought it was going to suck but i was wrong its faster than brave and uses less battery too and has a syncing future to connect to the desktop app so no complaints from me
massive improvement over all other major browsersublock and darkreader make the web actually usable especially ublock it actually saves my battery life
please let me disable background video playback silent videos are eating up my battery and old tabs are resuming playback unexpectedly just let us toggle background playback in the settings
how do you have such a superior desktop browser and a subpar app 4 minutes of use was equal to 4 of my battery refresh is in the side menu and not a pull down action uninstalling for now will try again in a few months i guess
the tab switcher is very inconvenient especially between private and normal tabs also the app makes the phone rather warm and drains the battery a bit other than that its alright
the best browser a power user can get on android i just miss some addons that arent allowed anymore
i tried the old version a while back and never really liked it however this one is so good all of the old problems such a poor scrolling performance and ui deficiencies are gone it is now a much more fluid experience than chrome with this browser battery life is also much better on my oneplus 7 pro than with chrome and i really appreciate the ability to use ublock origin the syncing functionality and the tracker protection i switched my computers to firefox as well
opening the app it shut down my phone i was so scared i got hacked or something yes my phone was fully charged once i turned on my phone opened the app crash error tried several times same thing happened trash app 
i just changed my review from 5 stars to 1 star this app just lost all my open tabs with no option to restore them they are not even showing in recently closed tabs where i am actually able to find tabs i intentionally closed i still use it because its the least worse browser its the best way to put it so i can avoid any positive word if you are a simple user just use whatever is available on your phone if you are a power user life sucks
a great app overall fast and private but it drains a lot of battery even with advanced battery optimization
so happy to have an alternative to chrome  ms those big browsers take over your device disturbing  use up precious space  battery power firefox also works fine even if you have an older os take that microsoft not all users need or want every aspect of their phone  pc to be intertwined please developers let us have a choice btw mozilla this means you too i see you beginning to upsell more services dont go down the norton path now all about sales not service
1st need video assistant feature like samsung internet browser 2nd consuming high battery usage it is very heavy on battery
bugs out the keyboard too much to bother using will randomly teleport where youre typing will randomly add letters when typing if you click into a textbox instead of going to the end of the textbox it drops you somewhere arbitrarily in the middle thought it was my phone or keyboard at first but every other app works fine moto g power standard google keyboard
has no one noticedever since they have been pushing 5 g all the cell networks arent working very well really makes a person wonder what the f is going on
app suddenly stopped displaying websites correctly even mozilla support websites turned it to desktop opened it in safe mode restarted phone took out battery and put it in again reinstalled it again restarted it after reinstalling download another browser and it works just fine words appear in black squares and pictures seem either too elongated or glitchy to even be able to see have had this on my phone for 5 months now
years along firefox is the best browser both on pc and mobile chromium gotta get outta mah face
give my aboutconfig back until then ill be keep using chrome also dont ask me to switch to beta or nighty in that case i assume it as switch to chrome because why cant stable and aboutconfig exist together at all im power user i know what im doing and i want a stable browser
first think i noticed when i opened the app in just less than 2 minutes my phone was running lilke a rocket i recomend this app to anyone that is having any type of problem withe their cell phone seriously the nest ive come acrosst
love firefox chrome is still in charge but firefox is my daily driver its fast and customizable 3rd party extensions are available for everything try firefox and see what you think youre not cheating on chrome
very high battery usage wonder what this does in the background
firefox for android takes its death kneel i was forced to upgrade from ff 63 when my addons stopped working updating after reading all of the horrible reviews turned a once functional interface into a bumbling elementary attempt at creating an intuitive interface this is so poor and amateurish my conclusion is they must have borked it by design why to peddle frusteration packaged in power some gift tabs gone refreshing a page takes an extra tap clearing history deletes downloadskma
much slower than samsung native browser and chrome chrome was using up my battery so i have been using firefox but its very slow to load pages
quite franky i hate it start over from v68 each version since is progressly worse ff userbase has given up we use alt browser or old version apk no new users will try ff now bc it sucks addons are broken new tab system is painful we need aboutconfig inspect element page source local html i expect power  flexibility if i wanted a dumbed down uncustomizable interface id buy an iphone you had simplicity right in v68 the whole interface is now a massive mess stop screwing it up
thank you for not making a data and battery draining browser like google
firefox is a great browser my battery usage with it is only 6 and chrome sky rockets firefox is a great browser for privacy battery saving and speed
good thin less memory intensive browser it doesnt have some of the bells and whistles chrome does but it is also easier on whatever os youre using my chrome on my cell phone and tablet wouldnt upgrade so i uninstalled chrome and have switched much better
drains battery too much mozilla will have to fix this
jio simple waste network service i waste my money recharge jio network
too bad it used to be a very good browser edit even worst now when in background it consumes battery if websites request it
switched to my main browser as its very stable great battery life and the addons it has are excellent ublock origin an ad blocker with cosmetic filtering and dark reader for a true black dark mode these features generally dont exist for other browsers
been using firefox since i dont know when why on earth would you strip down and ruin the most robust browser available is beyond comprehension i give it two stars because it still kinda almost works no addons no config no whatever else why what is the reason a better browser experience it didnt happen 5 stars now you destroyed a great browser and now speak of correcting including and updating are the droogs in charge now 31521 its the future where are the addons
everything is first class but i have some issues while streaming youtube 1 when we play in fastforward the audio quality is crickling 2 when i try to play on full screen video not getting adjusted to screen properly also if i scroll down notification toggle and again sent it back the time and battery bar keep on staying in the video 3 video rotation issue as many users quoting videos are not rotating according to our position of mobile firefox please consider these
14032021  still unreliable still horrendous ui  especially on a tablet   ff has just lost a bunch of desktop users thanks to this when you want to sync across devices  cant use the same browser on both its time to switch to the one usable on both we dont feel theyre listening no matter what they say so were going 1592020  given up this is not going to be usable in any useful timeframe am searching other companies products for biz use because fennec will be eol shortly sad cant recommend current firefox  lost any trust in mozilla 1192020  backforward with history reimplemented  but buried in a menu nothing is being learned here more suspicious that this is absolutely not a privacy browser every day no way of disabling dns over https which bars you from using your own just hope theres no security hole in fennecmany render issues collections could be the new tab groups if someone sorts the ui  2882020new ui is an atrocity aboutconfig locked  and im highly suspicious that the privacy settings dont actually stop all telemetry  missing addons tab history eaten  no nav buttons  lack of back history is a huge problem for me  rather absurd battery use and on a tablet it kept loading sites optimised for phones daylight is a completely new browser and thus has to go up against everything else fresh and frankly it doesnt stand up to most of them adding clicks for common tasks is not improvement nor is using more screen space for less was angry with loss of time  workflow interruption until i found a replacement now im just sad  ive been using mozilla browsers since the original mozilla would recommend using practically anything else edit  adjust firebase leanplum no doubt others  for a browser touting privacy firefox sure contains a lot of telemetry edit 2  after a few days of dealing with tech illiterates who just want to use their tablets like usual im once again furious well done mozilla chrome has a bunch of new users and i doubt ill ever persuade them to switch away at this point did you somehow forget android is not just an os for phones
latest updates are complete trash tabs now constantly reloading losing any and all saved data tab selection scrolling is hot garbage configuration options have been obliterated typing is bugged out and frequently scrolls way off the page frequent but random bouts of multisecond lag before rendering a page and on and on all from the recent update i shouldnt have to want to avoid updates but its clear idiots are in charge of both design and testing just absolute garbage
if i had the power to change myself i would do it than to expect change from others
i say queen of wifi telsa miley ray show omg she got the power odney ou me togther odney ou mite be my rock i star odney ou true friend esinty ou my one in a millon cause my heart beat for love who own my heart elsa the queen does miley ou the one i adore the most he loudset elsa drive my heart in to night elsa dont want want feel me all night niggt long it been ling night imtelling you go home i never be replaced esinty 
recommended add ons you have got to be kidding so sad to see such a community piece of creation become so corporate thinking thats what happens when you give power to insignificant people who dont know what to do with it even microsoft edge has the right mindset but you guys just lost the plot internet is full of older versions use one and enjoy hopefully after sharp decline in user base which is not that big anyway they will rethink their strategy
with this browser you can listen to youtube with the app closed and with the screen off add adblock and you have a free of charge streaming service amazing
cannot import bookmarks drains battery few extensions white line at top of the browser laggy when browsing large forum threads
bring back old ui please fired whoever in charge with new ugly unresponsive ui design
firefox was known for the ability to tweak everything but this mobile app changed to the complete opposite they deactivated the aboutconfig the addons are limited to a select few the tabs are reloading on selecting them or when they are in background so no listening to youtube on one tab while browsing on another at least most of the times its not working or just for 5 minutes firefox is excluded from battery saving so its not an android problem and neither youtube page
too many permissions  intrusive ads  lacks of security features  did not block 3rd party trackers  3rd party cookies  lots of bug  consume a lot of ram  my battery drains fast   and why is it that everytime i go to facebook when i select the message tab it always open the messenger app  
userfriendly if you ask me but for some reason most of times after quiting the app it keeps running on background and sucking battery
updated firefox after a long time the user experience went down the drain my customizations are gone cannot sort my bookmarks as easily now and have to click more buttons to get to the things i want compared to before they changed the browser to this quantum version would 100 downgrade back atm
it consumes battery more than chrome and also chrome works better with google search i choose firefox for privacy reasons but with these issues i will come back to chrome soon fix firefox please
for the first time ever i actually prefer this over chrome on android no hit to battery life and really nice to for larger phones
they have destroyed it been using for years as it was more like using laptop on phone than the others it updated itself to new version which just doesnt work tried to get used to it but forever crashing and not got all features as before so have deleted it problem is everything is apps now and thats fine if you always have the latest technology but not everyone can or want to change their phone every month simply dont have the space or processing power for constantly updating software
i cant search anything my phone power off ever time i search something it looks like this app contains virus
information not provided by developer this is a grave mistake by a beacon of privacy and a cyber security knight never do this again please thank you and now you cant save pages whom in charge of checkedin improvements
my new cell zte 10 for 17912979 came with google chrome loaded i use to use google chrome for my gmail email and firefox for my primary microsoft hotmail email address since these big companies dont seem to cooperate well just compete jammed chrome so now i just use firefox and feel much safer against all the media about chromes data mining thank you firefox donated 100 one complaint constant tabopen pop up no prompt customer service also poor public main page js on
xfininily network charge keyboard english message send emails tellusmore skydevice comwelcome to gboard clipboard any text you copy will be saved here
gating addons isnt cool bruh give power back to da people
good work mozilla team best things is plugin support and battery consumption is improved so much i am glad that i tried it out 
i am a power user and i feel that this is the best browser available on android for tech savvy better than chrome at most of the times
firefox had been my preferred browser since it first debuted but this latest version has caused me to quit using it entirely 1 slower page loading overall sluggish performance 2 massive battery drain uninstalled ff and batterys running like a champ again 3 browser started freezing up eventually it started freezing my whole phone up 4 nowhere near enough user settings and extension support is depressingly laughable at this point 5 we still cant sort our bookmarks
reporting you for not letting users uninstall the app completely this is bs and no one should even use your app at all  because i am warning everyone now it will kill your battery quick plus you wont be able to use your phone at all  this app is terrible 
updated to four stars after some improvements were made the app is still a battery drain though the update made the app terrible features are missing and i cant even scroll past images without it jumping to the top or bottom of the page
used to love this browser because of addon support and whatnot but the slow animations really push me to not even bother opening ff no power user features like setting shortcuts for each search engine like on desktop theres also a really annoying bug that sometimes prevents me from scrolling up in my list of tabs maybe the bug wouldnt exist if it wasnt able to be swiped too
i dont know why people have problems with this browser this is very good browser instead of using chromium engine firefox develop their own engine if you see any browser in the market for all platforms all browsers are using chromium engine i am using firefox on my phone and pc both it works very well more power to the developers thnx
it works well  lite app consume less processing power  in build privacy  overall experience is good
a browser that has been able to be used with ease i have less advertisements that come in and lots of things with getting on websites and being able to see compatibility with laptops tablets and cell phones
the guy who posted the pictures need to charge their phone also firefox is quite good compared to other browsers
i love ff use it on all of my devices on my cell phone though when you enter the first letters of the site you want to visit ff offers suggestions great but like a moment later it throws some search bar suggestions in front of that terrible so say you enter a few letters see the site you want to go to suggested and press that a moment before your finger reaches the address something else appears in its place this is so annoying that it makes it almost unusable
whether on pc or my cell its the only browser i use
much better than it used to be and doesnt drain your battery like chrome does
kills my pixel 3 xls battery granted thats not hard since the phone is also garbage but this performs worse than most browsers
a good browser but sadly unlike my pc my mobile phone isnt a nasa computer but one of those cheap ones without the heft and juice to melt an arctic iceberg so with regrets i have to use a sub par browser instead of this magnificent piece of wonderously and highly sophisticated software but seriously optimization is a thing but then firefox often used close to one gb of ram on my pc but yeah other than that its hands down the best browser
i like it because it means less power for monolithic google
just garbage and slow uses way too many resources and kills battery brave is so much better
cant loginsince google replaced firefox locks up  net congestion 2010 now it is 2021 version8441 has no sign in page have spent all of 2021 so far trying to get in and use it to restore my logins and passwords i printed them and they are locked in my safe am i the omly one hate to give ff a bad ratingstarted using it in the 1980s having switched back to multi billionaires reminded me of how much i was disgusted by their frequent villainy next they will be charging a buck just to sign in whether the browser works or not can anyone help me return to essentialy being an exclusive firefox user my first ff browser was a single digit
sluggish and a resource hog drained battery and used up too much memory new version is horrible so i looked for something better switched to a browser that is way faster and has great features bye mozilla
better than chrome has addblocker support why no aboutconfig and dont say nightly i want stable and power user features
firefox brings all of the power of chrome if not the speed with increased customisability and extension access for mobile which is a must have for me when going online in this day and age
slow stuttery cant find dark mode switch so i stick with opera not dark theme dark mode to change web pages to dark but i do appreciate image blocking for cell data but not enough to use this browser for the day to day page loading is slow vs opera
horrific usability bookmarks not easily accessible also runs in background and drains battery despite removing autostart permissions ff for desktop my favorite browser just not for mobile
godawful hangs my entire device so badly i have to rip the battery out even when i load pages that arent taxing in the slightest
battery life hog on huawei mate 20 and samsung s20 fe
i used to like this browser but they have gone on some sort of power trip trying to control what users can and cannot do the lastest decision is to block any taking of screenshots within the browser time to uninstall and find something else i guess
jus uninstalled chrome it was annoyingly limiting my power  but now firefox seems its gonna workout i love it so far  best feature extensions support 
open source magic the best chrome alternative for people who dont want to give google all the power in the known universe
seems to be lighter weight than chrome its a good browser and deserves a place on my phone i love the address being on the bottom where my thumbs are always seems like firefox leads on innovation but gets overlooked due to marketing power
the one addon i use firefox for even no longer works since the addon store is now running a whitelist model this would generally be acceptable since many browsers cant use addons the desktop version can but i used this addon for ages on your mobile browser with no issues this is a deliberately made step down taking power from the user i would appreciate any reply explaining the reasoning behind the decision thank you
i have been experiencing some battery drain with chrome so i decided to give firefox a try so far so good i already disabled chrome and battery is lasting longer now keep up the good work and dont mess it up please 
needs work chrome is objectively a better browser in every sense faster better ui less bugs less battery usage the list goes on the only thing keeping me are the extensions this is the only way to get a decent ad blocker on android without rooting or using some sketch privacy browser however even extensions need work because you can only use 12 out or the 1000s available for desktop which never used to be the case wth
someone has clearly hacked mozilla this browser has been hobbled everything i say here applies to when i downloaded the december 16 2020 update today december 22 2020 can still no longer access aboutconfig this was the biggest reason that i used firefox over every other browser mostly because it allowed for toggling of javascript not to mention all of the other things that it allowed you to do tabs can still no longer be rearranged when switching between them when i open a new tab sometimes i just want my tabs arranged so that tabs from the same website or similar websites are right next to each other its way easier to get something done when you dont have to scroll and scroll and scroll back and forth between two tabs you could just find your tab and go pages can still no longer be saved as pdf it wasnt my format of choice but it did at least save a web page to my phone for later viewing and comparison to the live web page it was especially useful for electronic receipts for purchases the entire url of a web page can still no longer be viewed all at once i used to be able to just tap on the url bar and then delete and replace the last character of the url which made it appear in a gray box between the keyboard and the url bar this was useful for taking screenshots of problem urls of websites there are now only 18 addons available not the thousands that there were not even a few hundred there are less than two dozen addons eighteen we dont even get a user agent switcher i used to love firefox because it would not overheat my phone with the new engine my phone has reached temperatures in excess of 105f not only is that uncomfortable its extraordinarily bad for the battery so this app can now actually damage my battery thats not    cool bro  a once great browser now made worse than even the most google of browsers what happened other than the major functionality disabilities that this now entirely different browser has at least the visual style has been refreshed classic it looks like something youd get in 03 on your desktop computer to make windows look futuristicits an ugly dated look and i actually really really dont like it    pro tip you can sign in to the google play store in a real web browser this doesnt feel like a real web browser anymore and write a review that is longer than the arbitrary limit that google has imposed of just 500 characters long in the google play store app for example this review is now 2745 characters long this will better help you tell mozilla in a public forum exactly what they did wrong with their browser there was a time when firefox was our browser clearly that has changed
i have used ff since it came out but this version for android has become useless because among other reasons noscript although it adds is inaccessible what were you thinking its as though the trump administration were put in charge of mozilla whiskeytangofoxtrot
not as easy on battery or memory as i would like but worth it to use firefox make sure you turn off their silly wifi locator service to get rid of that annoying background battery usage notification
a pc like browsing experience but a power hungry monster please make it light on resources
for some reason this app think im using a computer and not my cell and all i have is my cell and now the app will not open
very taxing on battery life probably a bug  not yet as speedy as promised with the new update but its getting better
excellent browser much less spammy than any other seems to be less drain on the battery as well
new updates drain my battery like crazy now 100 to 50 in 4 hours and im not even actively using my phone during that time aside from the saved password popping up correctly now literally none of the changes have been helpful
dont know how but i cant find my review of firefox anymore the recent ui overhaul is absolutely a downgrade with many functions and options removed who is in charge of development anyway why make a downgrade instead of an upgrade i have uninstalled the latest version from playstore and sideloaded the previous version before the overhaul from apkmirror firefox singlehandedly made me disable autoupdates for all apps yes the latest update is that bad and actually a downgrade
latest update started consuming over 80 battery had to uninstall to even charge the phone 6 months later its still a battery hog lame
i am unable to shut off the camera and voice or sound and it keeps draining my battery
i liked the old firefox mobile better this new one is missing aboutconfig u2f support and the ability to view page source basically they replaced a good mobile browser with this half baked replacement basically unusable for any power user who wants more than a barebones browser guess its time to switch browsers
the last update is really nice but i noticed an increased battery power consumption also the youtube videos dont scale well with the screen on my redmi note 7 and its important because i use youtube on firefox to avoid watching ads for everything else is doing well update youtube dont resize well the screen on fullscreen so part of the video is unseen mostly subtitles please fix the issue i dont use youtube app because the insane amount of ads
ive been using firefox on my computer and phone for a while now the syncing between platforms is great as are the security features and the fact that its quick and doesnt take up too much processing power no complaints
eats so much battery and data compared to other browsers  its fast tho
this app is power full but if ui design littel user handy thas greet
please bring back the old ui new one is worse search bar at bottom is just silly new tab page icons too small and most extensions just dont work you cant even access about config this is a problem when a large number of ff users are power users i got force updated today and rolled back again as its unusable now which required using the sync that didnt sync everything it said it did it doesnt matter if its faster if the usability is a big mess
bug cant open a link to a pdf eticket chrome opened it fine review im enjoying the new design so far it seems like a more polished slick web browser i like the list view instead of large icon view for tabs im not a power user so dont miss the missing features too much but hope that firefox will implement them back in again
the ui for everything after ver 68 is just terrible the flood of onestar reviews should be a warning to all this is not the ff that was good double tapping to make a new tab on the top of the screen is gone bookmark sorting is gone tab information density is dumbed down and shows a list with no manual sorting mozilla please roll back your ui remember we are power users and dont like removing features for the new web
ruined hate the dark theme and cant turn it off  select light it stays dark do select by battery saver and it goes light but text cant be seen then as soon as settings are exited it goes dark again and who thought purple was a good idea but as a long time firefox fan i persevered only to find my favourite forum page is stuttery and laggy to the point of uselessness a forum page really its vbulletin ive no doubt mozilla will fix it been here before but until then back to chrome
becoming unusable bookmark changes suck addons are almost nonexistent have you tried to change download directory impossible did ms buy firefox and i missed the memo i cant believe i am using my default samsung browser instead now 1st time in maybe 7 years i am uninstalling firefox sad day indeed newest feature must turn screen off with power button to get videos out of full screen mode galaxy note 9
firefox app used to be great recently it has gone downhill fast ive noticed firefox using background data and battery despite these settings specifically being turned off for it i force stop the app to prevent this and it just turns itself on some time later time to chose an alternative browser that doesnt have ulterior motives
ruined it they totally ruined the fact that firefox for android used to be a very low power consuming browser among the others from the store and now turned this into a battery draining one speed has significantly improved but  undo closed tab notice appears at a very inconvenient place while using the screen horizontally  tabs placements now cannot be reorganized in the drawer like it was always possible in the previous versions by simply dragging them around way to go mozilla 
been a fan on ff for many years ever since the update many things have gone down the drain the layout changes are not intuitive eg toolbar is up but to add new tab the  is below history and offline site data now has less control than before really regretted clicking on the update button not withstanding the above comments now i cant even move tabs downgrading to one star what a sad turn off events
thats my rating so far because the cleaner i installed completely rearranged my whole phone overnight so i uninstalled the cleaner and now im trying to fix my phone i have to literally find and reset all my apps annoyed doesnt even begin to explain how i feel right now and considering that i dont know much about cell phones im not having a good day sincerely darlene hail 
why did you remove text menu in favor of pull up menu where is the ability to edit bookmarks why shorten menu items we are used to seeing on desktop firefox i used to like but this version has no practical menu for power users used to desktop version why are you forcing users to update and lose functionality of favored addons that are not being updated yes you added addons but those are not the ones i loved i find myself trying out other browsers now pity
edit 3 114 still no fix basically worthless ive used and loved firefox both desktop and mobile for many years have never had this kind of problem bring back the previous version edit no mozilla the help forum helped nothing from all the other recent reviews i see your upgrade has severe problems stop wasting our time data battery and patience edit 2 1022 another update later and things still dont load tabs still dont close automatically 
new  the downloads are always stuck and not charging the bar remains gray forever on other navigators it works im on miui 1105 it works when i long press the download url and choose  download link but its kind of annoying
i do not like that when i click on the firefox icon the app opens as google or chrome i want the firefox browser app its the only one i trust i have a samsung a20 cell phone that i use most frequent  a k88 tablet neither sustain the ff browser as google overrides it for that reason im having to uninstall it can anyone direct or assist me in fixing this issue
new upgrade ok but 1i need quick access 2 addons noscript  ext download mnger like w the older browser 2the linkselectedastext issue seems finally resolved but the new browser is very unresponsive to linktap  pinchzoom 3i prefer opening to last page viewed  new tab to a page of my choosing instead of firefox default page 5give me the power to customize the fundamentals instead of u forcing them on me sorry but switching back to older flawed but less frustrating browser
used to be an excellent browser has been my goto android browser app for the longest time lately it seems everytime i launch the app my phone alerts me for the app creating abnormal battery drain i end up killing the app process going to applications  storage and cache  clearing storage mozilla please fix this app
generally i like firefox however the new update is clearly glitchy now when i listen to podcasts i have to keep that website open and on top of the other apps or it shuts the podcast off after 60 seconds i timed it then i have to go back to the web page with the podcast and reload it to start listening to it all over again this is really annoying in general but even worse at night when im listening to a podcast in bed previously i could shut the screen off and listen in the dark now the screen has to be on all the time which is wasting my battery ive gone through my setting on the app  phone from one end to the other trying to find some setting to change but it doesnt exist please fix this 
browsing is generally good but performance is lacking also consumes much more battery than chrome
i am a long time ff user latest update to mobile version is a complete sham first basic everyday functions have been purposefully obfuscated my guess to discourage users from clearing cache upon exit second why is there no option to close all tabs upon exit tabs stay active needlessly draining resources and literally opening highway for bad actors this drainage coupled with androids obsession with all apps run in background compounds the problem this last crapdate is suicide to ff mob
25062015 characters too smal in facebook web page 03062015 fast inly for a higher hardware performance25042014 unfortunately after 1 month of use it is still hungry consume a lot of cpu power thus decrease battery life 22032014 aprs installation je voit une grande amlioration depuis la premire vue mais jattends  lutiliser dabord avant de donner mon avis final
app continues to go down the drain constant restarts crashes buggy scrolling slow loads looking for a different browser now update now with the end of october update it is completely non friendly no ability to download no ability to edit bookmarks this is totally and utterly useless so i have moved on to opera you better wake up firefox youre being relegated to the trash bin of history
whoever is in charge needs to be fired for this update its slower uglier and confusing listen to the reviews change it back
firefox used to be a simply great browser now it is not they keep adding bells and whistles that slow it down and make it burn battery life
2 windows of firefox opens simultaneously when i open the browser on my oneplus 8t this consumes more ram  battery please fix this issue
was the best now just awful latest upgrade terrible leaves tabs open eats up battery seems like a useless beta version not ready for launch looks like going to have to use chrome come on mozilla get this mess sorted
not private not acceptable even though all privacy and security settings are set to the most restricted level and i use qwant as search engine im still targeted with ads in other apos that are clearly and directly related to my previous searches in the firefox browser in addition this app runs in the background and uses ca 3 of battery per hour even though background activity is disabled
firefoxs latest update has shattered the app for normal usage links to the most popular site links twitter google etx no longer work the preview for browser tabs has been replaced with an unreadable slot interface and everything defaults to starting a new tab when you come back to the app resulting in multiple tabs sapping processing power this update has forced me to stop using firefox on my phone for the first time since investing in a smartphone its a real shame
my all time fav browser would recommend has a few flaws but generally im content last closed tabs would be a nice thing to have also better power management i want my tabs to survive when i switch apps def edit user experience vastly diminished with the new update there isnt even a back button now this is a design failure not a step up last edit app is horrible now deleted after all these years i had to say goodbye
i would like to understand why it appears my cell phones do not access the same web pages as my desktop computer
i have had firefox on my laptopstabs and cells since 2008loved itnvr had a probbut the update they did last night destroyed my lifewhy couldnt you guys have warned us to back up our passwords and bookmarks before you wiped them out you guys have no idea what you have done 12 yrs of saved pws and important bookmarks were deleted by your update poof gone you ruined my life i have uninstalled firefox on all 5 of my devices i will never trust you or use any ff apps again thanks
hate the new update yes hate what was biting you in your ass that you had to charge it so dramatically long time user but now i have to find a replacement f you firefox f u
looking more like a good browser still missing home screen still missing broader add on support i am also noticing hefty battery drain due to firefox13 since last full charge12 hours its better hopefully keeps getting better
who ever is trying to kill mozilla with this feature stripped travesty should be fired and the crew responsible for the desktop version should be engaged on an emergency response basis to restore the fully functioning version updated of course that made mozilla the beloved power house of a mobile browser we all once loved
you know i really like this app cept for one thing i needed to print my paystubs in order to get approval for a lease and the only way i had to pull them up my pcs ram died recently was through a browser i dunno who thought that people dont need to print anything or would have another way of doing so but i strongly disagree were in a day and age where cell phones cost more than computers a lot of people only have a cell phone so this is a gross oversight
mozilla ruined firefox with their new release breaking the addon which restored youtube background play which is needed to extend the battery life of the device unacceptable i hope they at least are getting paid by google to piss their users off hope to hear back from these usually fantastic people about a fix to their major goof or at least a confirmation about them getting paid to do it intentionally will update my review upon a fix or if theyre at least getting paid to ruin ff
much buggier than the previous version background power draw it drains my battery like mad tabs that just refuse to do anything youll need to restart the app tabs that randomly refresh just after you spend 5 minutes on editing a comment very agressive tab unloading from memory it just keeps a few tabs in memory on my 4gb phone previous verion could easily have 10 open i feel were back to the buggy browsers of the year 2003 alpha software not production ready
please let us organise our bookmarks this basic feature has been missing forever also directing anyone who leaves a bad review to your forum is very unhelpful this isnt some obscure feature only for power users  allow people to use your software in the way theyd like
after the recent overhaul update firefox has gone down the drain who thought this was a good idea switched back to brave browser and happy with my decision
i use firefox on my pc and cell have always been happy with it
only reason i had it was because i could shut my screen off and it would still play music not draining battery new wonderful update took that feature away
i have been a user of firefox for the past 10 plus years and never thought to use another browser as the functionality was excellent new version eats battery crashes three or four times daily fails to load many sites hangs at 25 load bar doesnt auto fill my saved usernames and passwords saved against my account unless i search for them and load from the menu dropdown etc i have now reluctantly switched to chrome please fix or give us back the previous version before firefox daylight
longtime user of firefox but this latest update really is awful huge battery and data drains addons only half work and suspicious activity while the app was supposed to be off there was a time when i thought firefox could have really competed with chrome but it seems greed and short sightedness got in the way i can no longer recommended firefox to friends or family
when you update you must power cycle your phone the browser will simply not function until you reboot your phone thats the only downside the latest version is so fast makes my phone feel new again
please enable aboutconfig for this version the beta and nightly are just not stable enough for regular use also please bring back the old settings or atleast give the user an option to enable these things in the new settings ive been enjoying firefox for many years it remains to this day default browser on all my devices but the recent change of removing power user features is just a pain
another brilliant piece of hot garbage from our friends at mozilla who in their infinite stupidity have yet again foisted another version of their lackluster and horribly designed android browser upon the universe it seems the company motto is does it work then lets dink with it until it doesntits what the customers want whomever in in charge of this program needs to be dragged out into the street and beaten to death with their own shoes
the cell app does not quit reliably and i must force shutdown and clear cache several times daily
doesnt work with flash also it freezes my phone so often and to the point where i have to take out the battery or wait ten minutes
i use the pc version for more than 10 years i think but recently the pc version is a pain to use the most memory hungry programme in windows and the plugin container always crashes but in android it is far better only thing i miss that the cache clear option and tracking deactivation option update 30092010 after the latest update whenever i connect to internet in my moto g4 plus the system is showing that firefox is using battery without opening it why is that
if there is one thing ive learned in lifethats to be patient thou im not happy or pleased with the most recent update or downgrade however you want to look at itive learned to use it and find the better qualities as opposed to using other web browsers those in charge hear what we miss and what we want back before its to late im not going to go into my issues i have had only because everyone else has said it a thousand times now all we want is for you to help us
the new update is horrible for firefox power users no more aboutconfig access the destop mode reverts and hardly works less user customizations hope they bring these features back or may be forced to switch browsers
my phone says this is draining my battery it also doesnt support last pass
ive been a loyal firefox user since before we could get firefox on our cell phones my dad showed it to me and every computer i get i install firefox first thing even my macbook pro when i learned there was a cell version i made it my default browser never had issues like i am now ive closed all open windows restarted my app and phone and it isnt helping i get a black screen and my entire phone freezes up so i cant exit the app i have never had problems with firefox like this
faster lower power and resource consumption than chrome andba free open internet that respects privacy
the new version cannot turn off the screen when listening it waste my battery in just for listening i like the old version
the latest update is noticibly slower to load pages and remains unresponsive until the content finally does load even scrolling down a page i have to wait for the next batch of content to load i find myself waiting interminably on sites i used to navigate with no problems this is happening whether on wifi or cell connection also some page elements flash or flicker during page loads altogether not a very enjoyable experience i hope these issues can be addressed soon
lost my home page difficult to access bookmarks ad blocker seems to be crippled i dont need your stupid front page that blathers garbage i only need to see once cant we concentrate on usability instead of feelgood its as though they want you to drop it like a hot potato was it a corporate decision to make the worlds best browser suck now if i leave it running i get warnings from android system that firefox is using the battery not a good thing not ready for prime time removed
latest update dropped support for all my privacy addons was more then happy to exchange slightly slower speeds for better battery life and not being tracked around the net
with daylight it is clear that mozilla is steered by ux people and not power users a second apocalypse where the addons dont work getting rid of aboutconfig really edit after developer review i switched to the old firefox for the time being at least until the addons and the aboutconfig work again thanks for the response
downgrade at apkmirror pass it on i use firefox on my home computer cell phone and tablets this last update made firefox on my cell phone worthless and i downgraded it back to 68101 if the creator of firefox browser is reading my review dont stop supporting firefox for xp operating system me and many other people will use xp operating system as long as we can security of my home computer starts with the internet browser and antivirus it has nothing to do with the operating system
recently updated it to a new and improved version it no longer supports an addon that i do not browse without and the application is a huge drain on my battery
need more feature and addon extention use more battery than usual browsers
pros 1 easier on system compared to chrome 2 you can install addon like deaktop adblocker eg ublock origin directly on your phone for a clean web experience 3 clean easily customisable home screen devoid of click baits articles 4 enhanced privacy courtesy of strict permissions and privacy addon 5 firefox account allows seemless transfer of tabswebsites between different devices with 2 clicks really useful for power user also firefox bring back those old features
ever since the new update the app keeps running in the background wasting battery even though i keep putting it to sleep
extremely high battery drain on my device there are multiple people on forums everywhere complaining about this i tried reinstalling but that was a waste of time and lost all my ff data because sync didnt really synchronize my data back to finding another browser ffs to addtheyve removed all but a handful of addons useless browser now
whats the point of forcing so many changes in a single release i was used to a simple interface that worked perfectly and i am disapointed to see things were changed for the worse moving the address bar at the bottom is very counterintuitive and doesnt improve anything its unfortunate the engineers on the project never heard of the power of sameness i just switched to opera that feels so much more smooth snappy modern and intuitive in comparison
it seems to drain the battery much faster than other browser
i use this browser because it allows me to reorder my tabs manually which is a lifesaver but firefox drains my battery like crazy
dislike the new layout if tabs homescreen etc wasnt broke why did you mess it up 20  year supporter disappointing and looking for another browser for my android also upgrade loaded without my permission while tablet was charging with ask me on all upgrades previously selected 
since nearly as far as i remember the browser of my choice on computers also used it on my phones and now who the f is in charge for releasing a bag of data trash its not primarily a browser its more like typing  finger clicking never brings you to your desired web destination what the hell is wrong with you people at mozilla renders a lot of websites unusable updates didnt change the fact that this firefox mobile browser killed the app in total
as someone who has used firefox on web for over a decade and mobile for years im deleting because of this irreversible garbage update prior version was perfectly fine changes to the ui is annoying no addon support for whatever atrocious reason address bar at the bottom whoever is in charge of mozilla mobile is on hard drugs bring back the functionality of the browser i love just when i thought 2020 couldnt get worse lmfao  tell me you are actually reading these reviews mozilla
ff can no longer print to pdf ive used this feature extensively and now its gone without a warning as for the other changes recently introduced none are even remotely useful ff just continues to go down the drain
the new 2020 update removed all the best features and the main reasons i used it instead of everything else tab queues extension support direct share to desktop ff  more are gone old review pages load slow compared to opera or chrome the crash when long pressing the power button to take a screenshot has been fixed i also wish there was fast tab switching by swiping the top bar like in chrome the ability to use extensions and sync with the desktop browser is excellent though
only reasons why i was using firefox were the addons which are no more available since the new update i had meticulously configured them to have exactly what i wanted with utmost satisfaction all down the drain now time to go back to chrome
hate it it does not play well with disqus at all keyboard flashes back and forth between alpha and special characters  its like playing whackamole to type one letter eventually android freezes up and i have to reboot with the power and volumedown key didnt have this problem with the previous firefox version
best browser app by far secure and smooth doesnt hog up all your processing power
past 3 or 4 days my firefox app is draining battery at a crazy rate even after ive closed the app  10 in 3045 minutes force stopping firefox brings battery drain to normal until the next time i launch it i dont want to uninstall it because its the one i use across platforms but having to manually force stop everytime im done with the browser not an option either and the interface frankly sucks
if you dont have money to beta test your product please install your beta app on employees phones the janitor would have pointed out most of the issues we see with the new update i bet employees are using chrome on their phones i bet the marketing team some power drunk ceo insisted w stuff like collections and they all started rallying this idea for no reason in meetings those have no idea what really matters to the ux and they keep mixing it up hoping to get lucky fire them
became useless browser since few update once mozilla is known 4 hearing users voice now just forcing their product why should i use this crappie browser 1st eat ram  battery 2nd limited built in features against chromium like strict site isolation dark mode for web contents better built in site permission page load speed 3rd very limited extensions support slow responsiveness very slow on getting update or fixings bugs etc  lots of other factor which weak firefox against chromium
total trash i completely agree with pretty much every 1 star rating that has been written over the last couple weeks now my phone keeps warning me that firefox is using battery i cant stop it force stop clear cache restart phonenothing works only option is to uninstall
in the past firefox was an easy 5 star experience all day long with this new update its now an ugly mess and for the life of me i cant figure out why firefox was the perfect browser for both power users and those who have a hard time with technology like seniors now its not only more difficult to use its filled with bugs that make using it a nightmare gj firefox you gave up your spot as the browser of choice for those in the know in order to chase chrome customers youll never get gg
i apreciate the effort made to push such a fast update howver i see no mention about restoring the aboutconfig page and i have no intention of upgrading to any future version until this direct middle finger to power users is rolled back and an apology issued
well there are a lot of reviews saying what i want to say so let me tell what the app does which it shouldnt app nowadays seems to crash a little more frequentlyusually when on the same website for a long time if i leave my app open without using it in the background after some time my phone recommends me to force stop as it drains more battery than required i browse in incognito mode if you need to know and if you can please release a new app which consists the old version
i will need more help with transfer from lap too android cell phone
i love firefox but this newest update lets just say its not gonna work out i rarely leave a rating or comment for the apps i use but i really hope whoever is in charge at mozilla realizes their mistake
this is not an improvement with all permissions turned off set for no background data no background battery use within an hour and a half it used 34 of my battery
aboutconfig doesnt work cant disable certain things that annoy me awful update broken software and mozilla seems to be taking a lot of pages from googles playbook after a botched chrome for android update left that browser basically unusable on my tablet i thought hmm i guess its time to take another serious look at firefox only to find its a mess too only they close issues on github without doing anything about them instead of on a google bug tracker the web is really heating up
there is limit to genius but no end or limit to stupiditywith earlier mozilla i had the benefit of restarting my cell  all 90 tabs were restorednew version not doing so my linked comprehensive researches vanishedearlier version was extremely cell phone friendly and 90 tabs could be open at any point of timeincluding more than 100 restarts without loss of browsing continuitycurrent version of the mozilla browser is competition of superior idiocymoving to samsung browser
what did you do this last update is horrible nearly unusable ive switched to chrome on both my pc  cell because of it super sad because firefox has been my favorite browser for years
you have to keep the app open in the background now if you dont want it to automatically default to the mozilla homepage every time you open it even though mozilla boasts about tracking protection etc i often get firefox is using battery notifications if i dont completely close it unimpressed with this update considering changing browsers if its not fixed
the most important drawback of the update is that the newest update is draining my battery i also cant get used to the new tab system and am not a huge fan of the home screen but the battery issues may cause me to stop using altogether edit dropping review from 3 stars to 2 the load times are also significantly worse
it used to be good like until the resent updates the new update took away the things that i switched directly to firefox for which was how simple it was they simplifyed it too much and the fact that it used to support any i mean any addon no matter if it was made for desktop or mobile with out any extra stuff it just worked now only the bigger addons are supported which is good for most but not for me or some power users such a downgrade please let us have the old version as an option
this is a terrible update bookmarks have been made lessusable by having their size reduced to tiny moved to a separate area and have been sorted by lastaccess instead of alphabetically with no option to resort this makes bookmark items much harder to find edit so youve removed addon support for all but 9 preapproved extensions congratulations mozilla youve removed the last reason i had to keep your browser installed 10 years of goodwill down the drain
have always used firefox on desktop and mobile since i believe software should be free as in freedom not only free as in beer i have neglected to leave a review in the past as the browser did have serious issues with battery drain and overall speed but they have now been addressed in this new overhaul if youre not already familiar with mozillas ethos they are privacy centric and do not consider their users the product unlike google
well designed interface that easily surpasses chrome for android but it is too unstable crashes are so regular that i cannot recommend it for power users or anyone who cant stand instability edit above was in 2016 now in 2020 firefox is a dumpster fire lowering my rating to a 1 star
are you guys for real mozilla you guys need to realize that your bread and butter is firefox and the power users that chose this as your default stop trying to be chrome the whole point is that you arent chrome
new update is totally broken many sites i use daily mostly simple image boards and forums are completely failing to load content app is slow and crashes frequently address bar at the bottom is good in theory but if i have to tap 6 differ things to open a new tab instead of 2 thats a problem deleted half of my favorite sites from the home tab and replaced them with google and other generics that i havent used in years it also uses way more battery and causes my phone to get very hot
the update is a great advert for browsers from huge corporations that suck up our data opens additional tabs whenever its opened hangs and seems much slower i also now get warnings about high battery usage
the new update has removed most characteristic and likable features of firefox long time an example of customizability and power this browser became so overstyled and streamlined that it falls in no category of usability anymore how can you do this drastic change on a simple update from which the people can not roll back
i have been using firefox desktop and android for my business and personal use for years but i am very disappointed in the latest update to firefox android it eats battery power and requires extra steps to get where i want to go i am actually looking for other options
new version is mess customization is poor some settings seem missing very radical change and feel even with the new energy saver mode it seems to burn through the battery almost twice as fast since it was the only upgrade done it seems pretty bad very disappointing upgrade
the latest update is slow it seems to burn my battery down quickly it holds all my history in tabs it doesnt clear my history like i had settings for in the previous version hate it if i can find a way to revert back to the previous version i will
really need to allow the app to be moved from local storage to sd card not allowing this is causing storage issues for power users that have many phone apps
very bad and slow is going on using my phoen battery
i dont particularly care about the uiux changes i care about extensions and power user tweaks sure aboutconfig is back if you run nightlies but the extensions i used may never return their only crime deemed either unpopular or unfit by mozilla an end of an era for the mosaic killer
this aint it mozilla i dont know who was in charge of the redesign but they should be fired removing most of the addon support really do i really have to leave my favorite browser please fix this or i will have no choice
completely broken and unusable 20yr power user no more what an absolute disgrace managed to completely bungle the browsing experience and its as if this is the first browser they have made seriously backwards progress uninstalled my desktop dont expect anything you get what you pay for nothing
a less functional ui removed configuration options disabling almost all extensions and lots of bugs your cavalier attitude to breaking the browser for your longtime and power users is baffling they are the foundation of your install base and thus your funding no one installs ff by accident it is they who recommend it to their families friends and colleagues and replying to reviews by copypasting the same nonanswers again and again is only adding insult to injury
android version unfortunately still terrible after first fix to v80 very awkward access to bookmarks worse even in incognito the incognito start screen improves nothing and requires more clicks and motion for everything switching to just opened tab frequently requires scrolling despite performance claims loading sites is painfully slow serious lags in particular on mediajsheavy sites dialogues on sites frequently unclickable or jumping around battery usage is through the roof
i am super pied off that the newest version of firefox for android only supports 9 addons only 1 of which i do or will ever use of these 9 the addons are the power behind firefox i depend on the functionality of the addons i had for my livelihood especially being stuck at home during this pandemic the customizations allowed in this release are about the equivalent for a 3rd grade girls tea party maybe when contacted support told i cant go back to previous version or lose everything
new version seems a giant step backwards privacy protectipn alright but usability has gone down the drain no bookmarks around i see just an empty search screen i cannot find sites i visited yesterday i have no idea what they had in mind
wow obviously no focus group of power users was involved in this rollout  what a mess biggest problem for me is that tabs are not easily available for navigation being buried under a menu and you have no idea what is open without displaying the tab page sorry mozilla after 15 years colour me gone
this is a great browser with good ergonomics unfortunately there are some issues the first issue is that sometimes after resuming the browser a page doesnt load the only way to overcome this is to copy an url and follow it the second issue is a glitch line at the bottom of a page where an unsuitable part of a page is displayed it doesnt depend on the browser bar location the third issue is the battery drain even in the background when the browser hasnt been used for a long time
feels like they fired the wrong employees this update has me thinking that the guy left in charge is a spy from chrome
i dont understand the review bombs i got the update to 79x days ago and have 0 usability issues all the extensions i care to use work just fine i even use a proxy with authentication for my browsing just fine as many sites block speedify bonding vpn the new feature with the browsing bar on the bottom makes navigating with one hand a snap add a nice ad blocker along with dark reader for a comfortable and battery efficient web experience optionally you can add a couple privacy extensions
firefox daylight fenix is a disaster ive used firefox mobile fennec for 10 yrs from its huge catalog of extensions to builtin features like aboutconfig save as pdf reader mode and firefox sync there was nothing like it i ran with 50 tabs synced to my desktop no sweat daylight kills this gone are aboutconfig save as pdf  most extensions you cant even reorder tabs firefox is a browser for power users so bring back the power or your last few users are gone like me
awful after the latest update unstable on older hardware tabs structure makes no sense and gets even the basics wrong  which tab is what and which tab is open always opens up a new tab on launch  why websites render weirdly and apparently its a resource hog that drains my battery in the background come on mozilla you can do better
the previous version was so much better change for the sake of charge even login info does not get imported from firefox account properly let alone scrapping the master password in case it upsets someone seriously
its kind of crazy the people in charge thought it was a good idea to push out a beta browser missing many features
was a 5 now with this newest update i am ranking it a 1 absolutely hate the way it cuts everything off on my cell phone makes my banking site completely useless
hello my browser has not been working properly for some time when i turn on my phones data and wifi the app subconsciously opens and a new page opens which is an advertisement for an instagram account sometimes it leads me to see the ad in the telegram messenger app this is really annoying i do not know the source of this annoyance because sometimes i feel that i do not have control of my cell phone and i am worried please solve this problem thanks
the latest release has many problems 1 no aboutconfig the control afforded by aboutconfig is a tremendous advantage of firefox having it available in the stable release allows everyone to benefit from its power 2 the upgrade appears to have reset the custom settings id made in the previous release 3 it doesnt seem to be possible to have bookmarks on the home page this means it takes three taps instead of one to access a bookmark 4 going back to the home page from a tab leaves the tab open tabs have to be closed manually 5 tabs arent even displayed as tabs any more 6 still its not all doom and gloom at least pocket has been removed
now that ive had a bit more time with the new ui i can see the frustrations other people mention first why is the address bar at the bottom that makes zero sense secondly the tab window is wasteful with each tab taking up the full width of the screen and not user friendly the old way made more sense the squares im not a power browser user and luckily the one add on still works for me but im already hating using this new update and am thinking of uninstalling it good job mozilla
i love firefox but just dropping most addon support without any way for the user to manually override it kinda kills half the reason i switched from chrome a few months ago please either add an override for more technical users somewhere or at least make it easier to rollback to a version that supports them while power users wait for more addon support to return if it werent for dark reader still working id probably switch back to chrome
went from bad to worse phew i thought i needed a new tablet because it was getting so slow but all i needed was a new browser and it aint firefox they must have put dejoy of usps fame in charge they took something that was fully functional slowed it down then wrecked it whoever heard of a browser without a back arrow
latest update completely changed the usability of the app cannot imagine why mozilla would give the go ahead to force an update that removes features like a back button addons usable bookmarks etc totally ruined workflow its a straight downgrade however you look at it leave the flashy but locked down stuff to apple and keep firefox the customizable browse for power users ive uninstalled for now will check back when removed features from the old browser have returned
are there literal monkeys in charge at mozilla hq this redesign is really really badthe bright purple is ugly several vital features are missing theres literally one customization option aside from theme youll disable extensions but wont provide solutions for the problems they fixed no download manager no cookie manager theres not even a back button anymore i genuinely want to know who greenlit this back to chrome it is
no start page select or stay where you left as use to be hangs often show white pageand even go back still show white page some links impossible to open simply cant use it anymore at all one positive  dark mode but what the point if everything else is broken on mobile device we need less beauty and more functionality also power saving is important 2 days of torture cant use it anymore keep for some time and if not fix will remove
18 years with firefox this new upgrade sucks cuts off all podcasts in one to two minutes if you dont keep the window open like your watching a video burns up battery power throws all your bookmarks out of order i never liked the way firefox bookmarked any ways you had to start with a clean slate and enter them in the order you wanted them had about a hundred no option to alphabetize or move them the way one wants them like i said liked it before the newest update bye bye firefox
horrible horrible horrible newest android version is horrible home page is ugly and cant be customized cant get to anything easily everything opens in a new tab and there is no easy way to close tabs must manually close them one by one firefox has long been my favorite browser i will no longer be using it on my cell phone essentially nonfunctional and not worth the hassle
mozillas failure as a company has rendered this once great mobile browser into unusable trash the massive hemorrhaging of battery life has forced me back to chrome so sad
if you loved ff before aug 2020 do not update i just updated today and really wish i had read the comments here first as one of the power users who regularly keeps 50 tabs open the update has severely crippled my productivity i hope the mozilla team puts back or at least gives us options to view our tabs as previews blocks again as an android user i loved that i can still customize my browser themes the same as on my desktop ff not with the new update is there a way to roll back 
i have been a firefox user from the beginning and have contributed money to the project i always preferred it even when other browsers received higher ratings in the press but the new version for android is unusable on a tablet it may be fine on a cell phone but i only use a browser on a phone when no other option is available
this was a great app ruined by forced update settings were wiped out now audio cuts off when the screen closes app is alowed to use battery in background mozilla help search shows 269 articles on this none of which offer a solution for this problem on mobile site this is a new problem generated by the update that mozilla shoved down my virtual throat thanks for nothing  now i have to go download chrome this sux
the new update removed what made firefox on android special compared to chrome firefox will always be an inferior browsing experience and the removal of desktop add on support and the other customization options took away my final reasons to use firefox without what made firefox the special browser that it was why should i use it its slower uses more battery and has inferior rendering to googles product its a shame mozilla leadership wont suffer for their incompetent direction
i dont care for the new layout for fire fox i have deleted or disabled 99 related to google on my cell phone i use firefox on all internet capable devices including computers i wouldnt trust anyone else
amazing until the last update they changed the whole platform and made it way less user friendly and more difficult to work with its absurdly distracting and clunky i had recently switched over from chrome bc of issues i have with chrome as a company but i think ill have to switch back until this is resolved not sure who approved this design update but they shouldnt be in charge
the updated firefox looks terrible and functions worse than chrome drains my battery quickly too i get that mozilla needs money but why are they going about it the way google did with subtely gathering peoples information through offering a streamlined experience efficiency in the tech world is code for users being the product usually bottom bar thing is asinine at best and more an amateurish attempt to be new with this update revert back or come out and say that alphabet inc or whatever company operates the google umbrella is forcing parameters in order to be available on the play store
it looks like mozilla has drunk the form over function koolaid this new update is worthless it deactivated half my addons and will only let me use addons from a short list of recommended addons it tried to make me use google as my search engine shudder the home page is 100 times worse it longer populates with the most visited websites now it wants me to use collections who asked for collections the appeal of firefox mobile was that it behaved like the full desktop version used the same extensions aboutconfig granular control etc it was a power browser now theyve made it into a dumbed down mobile browser  just like every other mobile browser hope somebody forks the old version because i will bail on this as soon as that happens
no just no after using firefox as a browser on both my home computer and cell phones as my go to browser you removed my ability to have a homepage of my choosing i am utterly disappointed the change over was sudden and shocking you have lost a long time user
all of the addons are gone  hopefully whoever is in charge of what used to be the best browser firefox reads this because guess what now it is the worst browser major company wide failure for the decision makers
previous version more userfriendly and with features that are essential and no longer available in this upgrade might be time to start using different web browser why this firefox version change the navigation bar and automatically puts in split screen it is inconvenient makes it different to launch the navigation bar and some apps will not work in split screen mode one can always turn split screen on firefox messed up my device had to turn the power off  back on
the latest update has broken my most important feature previously i could start a youtube video using the desktop version then power off the screen and just listen to the audio with this new update the video pauses after 30s to a minute that desktop trick really separated firefox from all the other android browsers i feel like for all the new ui changes firefox has lost a bit of its luster
just installed brave due to your recent update your developer in charge of this new browser should go work for your competition lame
i use my cell phone to manage amazon orders on the go the new firefox browser does not have a print option now as far as i can see this means i have to go to my home computer to print out shipping labels and packing slips that i normally couldve done on any secure printer delaying shipping times when i cant get to said computer thanks but no thanks cleaner interface should not mean removing or hiding options that someone needs for business
new update is bad hate the way the tabs work now please undo it or give us an option to go back to the old layout and operation extentions dont work ive used firefox for years because of the power it had this dumbed down version is annoying and moving in the wrong direction will change review when app becomes useful again
this is a different firefox for android no mozilla firefox users are power users who consciously decide not to use the default browser it was a choice i would have found the change more acceptable if you had a separate browser as done for firefox focus and let users decide if the want to trade features for speed and a cleaner ui the approach to rolling out the new firefox does not help in the loosing battle against chromium it seems to be an act of desperation
since new update its killing my battery 10 usage running in the background
if you dont get this nightmare of update fixed i am moving to opera and i have been using firefox forever the guy who is in charge of this update is clearly working for chrome and needs to be fired immediately
since updated i hate it i have had firefox for years and just deleted it from cell phone and pc
omg what a nasty surprise to open my browser this morning and find this i enjoyed the old browser because it looked like a browser not an app now its just another cell phone app that doesnt do the things that i need to do without searching around and trying to find out how to get it done im sure ill figure it out eventually but i shouldnt have to id like to reverse the update and set it up so that it doesnt update
bad and unpopular update it autoinstalled this morning awful denigrates bookmarks and defaults to gridofidentical dull icons slower buggy pages dont render the right size i hate evil google chrome too mozilla is circling the drain
firefox mobile doesnt properly keep loaded websites cached so one has to load them over and over again  which wastes data volume time and nerves and if you have bad cell reception the website is just gone no matter how often you loaded it before  why isnt there a config option keep sites cached until the user refreshes them that would help so much also the last release lacks a lot of the functionality previous versions had
i dont know why you made these choices removing power from the user prevents from defending themselves the lack of aboutconfig means i am unable to correct your mistakes without forking the browser your interface is poorly designed and looks bad visually there is no way to not load a blank tab and most options and addons are gone i would ask you to fix this but im positive youre no longer interested in supporting anyone smarter than a kitten how hypocritical as an open source dev
junk ruined a good thing no longer opens to the page you were on instead this new tab garbage ui nothing wrong with the old one stoprefresh now hidden away automatically landscapes videos where you used to have the option for fullscreen portrait why change these features for no reason at least give us the option to add them back or actual customization like the desktop app also takes forever to load randomly and seems to consume way too much battery running in the background
the power of open source love you firefox  suggestions try to add swipe to go previous or forward webpage
new updates cant come soon enough this is horrible give us back the browser we had before the update the total lack of customization is repugnant yeah i can select my theme and the location of the toolbar what fun we are forced to use the firefox default home page using bookmarks are harder than its ever been and thats saying something and i cant even figure out how to go back over multiple pages seems to me this was a power play on par with something googlems would do
new update  terrible im a power user that took full advantage of all the various addons offered now they are all gone wtf i have always touted firefox over friends and familys other choices because well it was awesome now not so much it looks like ill be using something else unless something changes 
beware latest update the latest improvements to firefox are disappointing the gui is broken tab switching is ineffective aboutconfig cannot be accessed for power users telemetry is also enabled by default which is antithetical to the core the mission of firefox and mozilla foundation avoid at all costs luckily i found an old apk of 68101 which i immediately reverted back to i would recommend others to do the same i implore mozilla to correct the defects in the update
august 2020 update is terrible why have you taken away aboutconfig why cant i set what i want for the opening page your primary user base was power users but you took away all our control not good
firefox used to embody a free fullcontrol browser take back the internet or something by removing aboutconfig and giving no replacement for proxy javascript flash settings and forcing mainstream options youre alienating the customers that brought you to power little remains to distinguish ff from safarichrome besides cosmetics sad sad day thank god for old apk mirrors
it worked fine and now junk i think this latest update was just so the devs and upper braintrust could justify their wages nobody asked for this and the  people that work at firefox didnt even asked if we wanted it this is what happens when you put  in charge of things fire all who is responsible and roll it back next time ask before destroying something that people liked now we are promised by the same  that made this tragedy that they will fix what they broke pathetic
update ruined extension compatibility removed options and features and none of this was warned whoever is in charge of releasing updates should be fired firefox without extensions is windows without directx or win32 like those win rt tablets
stupid update i was used firefox on my samsung really good but this morning this app update however i had lost video play back on youtube while on call and cant not play video from youtube when put my screen off to save battery this update is a poor experimental now i cant listen music on youtube while im on a call anymore or off screen
my phone is locked up because of this stupid upgrade brand new phone on my wifi and app is swirling the drain and cant get past the settings update not happy downloaded duck duck go to solve internet search problem
if it aint broke then put the teaboy in charge mozilla seem to be heading the same way as google just doing whatever they want and only listening to the fanboys who are literally creaming over the bottom bar that everyone else hates the way to make an app less of a battery drain is to make it more efficient not recreating the ui to distract from the fact much of the functionality has disappeared
saved login functionality doesnt work they are stored but cant be used but stored passwords are now behind a less secure phone unlock pattern rather than a unique master password and to compound that i can see no way to bulk delete them display rendering of tables goes wrong where all fonts are supposed to be the same size firefox tries to guess what cell is most important and increases the font size for that cell the advantages that firefox had over chrome have gone
i have used firefox for many years in my pc but this android version is very bad it is draining my battery fast after update also i dont like the address bar that is now at the bottom also the private tab has moved to some place else
new  forced update is just terrible this must be the worst update for any app that i have experienced since i started using android nearly 10 years ago it will definitely lead to the demise of mozilla if this appalling update is not quickly and efficiently removed and reverted back to the previous version those in charge of developing and implementing this app should be fired
ive been using firefox since i can remember its my de facto browser for pc and phones too this last update is amazing i know some power user features are missing and i hope mozilla bring them back in a near future but as a whole this version is a ton of fun and i really enjoy the look and feel we should be more thankful with mozilla for working so hard against the merciless giant that google is privacy is key and mozilla even with their faults is doing a great job with firefox
use to use the app all the time cause extentions worked fine with it but since its been charged i can no longer use any so will be removing the app
i mainly used firefox for reading web novels and had about 50 open tabs which i used as bookmarks with this new update its become very difficult to get an overview and all my organisation went down the drain im pissed off right now and if nothing changes ill have to look for another browser and copy over those 50 some links 
the forced update on august 20 has ruined this browser i have used the android version of firefox since it started but i have changed my previous rating from 5 stars to 1 star because this is all it deserves now no communication about the changes before they occurred a more confusing interface and generally a much poorer product despite the claimed advances steer clear until they put the adults back in charge
i am unsure why people are laming around with the new visual update but i am all plus about the same the fresh ui feels solid has a great ux quick hack  use the bottom toolbar being a firefox user since 2012 its almost a cakewalk to proudly say that the mobile version is now heading on great route more power to you team mozilla 
was great up until the last update which made the ui awful it covers the time and battery bar at the top and is very slow
been using ff since launch newest update is terrible and unusable did anyone at mozilla even beta test this version sleek and power efficient should not replace productivity and task efficiency tabs being 2 in a row vs single file quick launch via home page those are good feature that you nuked for no good reason
latest release was a bit unexpected i can get used to the ui but the lack of power user options in the interface and the fact that aboutconfig doesnt work to circumvent those missing options has me looking for another browser especially since it still autocompletes urls even though i disabled that in the few remaining options
power user of firefox across multiple platforms latest update is broken all over all bookmarks gone no option for tab layout  new layout is just a waste of screen space i could go on most annoying of all half the pages dont load pages i have been visiting for 20years i have always recommended and installed firefox but as of this update will be refering people to there phones inbuilt browser till a major fix is applied 
its a battery eater and crashing on every opening tab nothing change to improve performance
the new firefox 79 is awesome but read other critical review first from power users
was always incredibly impressed with the power of ff on android but since the update it wipes your settings without notifying disables aboutconfig and offers no way to turn it back on even though it has other dev features like usb debugging if you wanted ff for the justlikeonpc features theyre gone even something as simple as having it run through a socks proxy its useless now well for what set it apart as firefox real browser now its just browser alternative 31
idk why people are posting so much hate  ive been a chrome user and recently switched to firefox and it was amazing  far better in ram management  faster and a cleaner experience updates are power packed plus you get some cool extensions 
an ultimate browsing experience with this new updated version few ve i really liked strict privacy controlbottom toolbar option  toppings of adonsthe best part is that it is not resource hungry like chrome edge or brave browsersbrowser war is really heating up chrome edge need to worry
almost killed my phone when a website with an unresponsive script kept being loaded every time i restarted the app could only get rid of this by uninstalling latest edit its unusable had to uninstall goddamn mozilla i know software isnt easy but you need to fire whoever was in charge of releasing this because you butchered it its unfortunate because ublock origin is the only worthwhile adblocker and only ff supports it on android afaik
still high battery usage on latest ff when viewing google colab the battery usage is significantly higher monitored using battery charging monitor even if i close the page google colab the battery usage stuck at higher level i had to force stop firefox to fix this please look into this issue why does it spike to high battery usage when viewing google colab your service suck you never reply reviews and emails
firefox 79 is the most beautiful browser right now the ui refresh is much welcomed it seems faster and draines less battery browsing is more smooth the different levels of tracking protection is also besutiful 5 stars all the way default browser is now firefox
new version  disaster ive been using firefox for android for a long time but i will change to other browser new ui is extremely confusing no way to set your bookmarks on the initial page many crashes sometimes the desktop version of the website is charged instead of the mobile even if the option is not active what a pity i loved firefox so far 
the last update is really a pure tragedy tabs  gone long tap on back icon for site history  gone scrolling with a touchpad on blackberry keyone  gone filling logins and passwords stopped working as well  even they are saved and there are other improvements which really suck im a long term firefox user both on pc and cell phone but this version is nearly unusable for me
dark mode is great but the loading screen  the blank screen while loading a web page are fully white a nice eyestraining blinding oversight that makes dark mode only helpful to the battery
before this was the best now crashes often only few addons are enabled no media controls on videos drains battery and the quick navigate thing is now gone in new tabs downgrade 
best browser out there with the power of addons its all you need for a perfect web experience 
ive been using firefox for 10 to 15 years its power and freedom to do what you want and not what they dont want you to do is my favorite thing about firefox
years this was my favorite browser no longer this is hot garbage now the new update doesnt load tabs in the background anymore which means data stops if i turn off the screen to continue browsing later everyone knows the screen illumination eats battery life the most so this feature is counter productive especially for users who have unlimited data and there is no work around it time to switch my default browser after all this time
last update is such a setback tabs are weird thumbnails are not working half the time broken autocompletes no addons no aboutconfig no tab reordering worse home screen zooming feels weird and at times glitchy you took a good browser where power users like me enjoy and reduced it to this good job mozilla 1 less user for you and if your desktop follows this trend you will lose me there as well
has not used app yet but if it can help unlock my pro browser lap top then i am eager and willing to evaluate with high ratings right now my microsoft pro browser laptop is locked i know the code but it is not unlocking this app can be used on all devices for private browsing fast safe and it is certainly secure i am going to use it on 2 android samsung cell devices one dell laptop and my microsoft pro browser laptop if it opens
the new automatic nondowngradeable update made firefox totally unusable im experiencing strange behavior on some sites strange behavior when i enter a urlgetting suggestions based on history with foreign characters mainly   and  i dislike the ugly ui and for some reason it disabled some of my extensions without the ability to enable them again im what some would say a power user and firefox on windows and on android have always been for people like me but not anymore it seems
the latest update 79 doesnt let us use aboutconfig for power users whats up with that
this new version of firefox needs fixing pages are not being rendered consistently if you temporarily open another app then return to firefox the page you were on does not show sometimes even a refresh or pressing the address bar to reenter the page doesnt work even the memory management of private tabs is not good i charged my phone which was not off then once fully charged my tabs were gone
each update only to make worst now drains my battery in less than 1 hour absolutely garbage useless
i guess we will never have customizable start page with folder bookmarks and convenient speed dials its the heaviest browser and the most inconvenient for power users with a lot of bookmarks the redesigned version goes from bad to annoying
ive been a firefox power user since first released on both pc and android i like my browser to work the way i want it to  ill use chrome if i want to be spoonfed its a sad day when i have to downvote firefox but the latest version is terrible the renderer is a mess theyve disabled aboutconfig for nonbeta settings is a ghost town i can no longer start in bookmark view by default top sitescollections lets reinvent the wheel but with triangles id go on but theres no room
i would give it to 5 stars if it wont drained my battery like a waterfall
best browser as it has extension support but it has insane battery usage like 3040 usage on my phone
heats up and kills battery within an hour of full charge
draining battery for reasons unknown unable to reduce the power consumption
i switched away from firefox 5 years ago because while it was decently quick it crashed constantly and was a memory suck i came back and after 2 days of use i can tell you its a different experience the browser still sucks your memory and drains your battery and the tabs still crash constantly bit now the browser absolutely crawls this browser operates like abandonware and its baffling to know that people still work at mozilla and are like doing work every day its just trash
was great but now draining battery by using 25 cpu when sitting in background
been using firefox since version 3 on windows and was happy to see they made the android version as i rather stick to a browser i already know and trust best thing about this is being able to sync my tabs between my pc and smartphone and its as fast on my phone even with multiple tabs open and does not drain my battery disappointed that no addons i installed works so far but maybe that will improve in the future
best so far use cell and win10 for many years
it drains the battery since the last update i have to charge my phone twice a day when i used to charge it once every day an half
what i need to power browse needs dark background  screenshot option 
much slower than the competing browsers does not leave me in the desired position on the webpage but throws me automatically on a random place also it gobbles cpu time battery and available memory uninstalled
very good app it will drain your battery with a lot of tabs open but thats on the end user i like that you can access ftp servers with it too well deserving of 4 stars but not quite 5
firefox preview is the best and fastest android browser around but this version is also great the plugins are very handy along with the ability to listen to youtube videos while the screen is locked or while using other apps is also very handy and great for battery longevity 910 for this version and 1110 for firefox preview i feel ff preview will end up being the 1 mobile browser in time
great browser but quite slow to start up and uses an excessive amount of gpu power for some videos
latest updates make this a battery eating machine will give 5 stars when battery usage goes back to reasonable
just great just fine just the power i needed yo rock on
caused battery drain firefox on pc is a lot better
i like how firefox is very secure however when i installed it on my new phone the battery started to drain a lot faster at first i thought i had a virus but my security scan found nothing i uninstalled firefox and my battery is lasting now i dont know what happened but it needs to have better battery optimization
disgusting it drains battery faster than other browsers and i recommend not to use
i was a huge firefox fan until i found out the browser was draining my battery had to uninstall please fix in future updates
thank you love this browser please one feature request i have 100 tabs open please provide an option that restricts tabs using the cpu which are not used many times firefox is the main thing draining my battery thanks guys good work edit as far as i know they did this with the new version thx edit2 why are you not allowing the app data to be backed up you have not set flag flagallowbackup why how am i supposed to transfer all settings extensions etcgoing back to 4 stars
everyone should visit browserbetter com to install the best browser app its block ads privacy and faster firefoxs great app but every time i download something even once its finished i have a persistant notification saying its still downloading stuck on a high number like 87 or 99 ive noticed increased battery drain while this occurs too to stop it i either need to forceclose the app in settings or restart my whole phone
firefox is getting power hungry now days is it possible to make it less battery consuming uninstalled change back to chrome and walah now my phone battery can last for years
great app but every time i download something even once its finished i have a persistant notification saying its still downloading stuck on a high number like 87 or 99 ive noticed increased battery drain while this occurs too to stop it i either need to forceclose the app in settings or restart my whole phone please fix
normally id give this 5 stars but the past 23 week it keeps suddenly crashing originally it only happened sometimes when i opened links in texts the page would start to load then crash now it happens constantly even when opening new pages within firefox it crashes 5 times within 10 minutes sometimes i use firefox on 2 laptops  my cell having everything synced for easy access is great i like using firefox over everything else  would prefer to keep using it please fix this asap
i am having an awful experience using firefox on my android cell phone firefox keeps loading on my history pages that i have not accessed some of which are unacceptable sites it also keeps disrupting my work flashing posts and adds everyday i have to uninstal firefox so that i can work on my cell this does not happen on my table computer what is going on is there a virus on this app getting very frustrated with firefox
good mozilla this is a great and secure browser for both light users and power users
do firefox have an add free browser that they charge for if so how do i cancel an accidental payment
extensions make firefox the best choice for browsing and downloading content on mobile devices it has built in adblockers ublock origin custom user agent integration with download managers bookmark and history constantly syncing with desktop and lets not forget privacy all this makes it the foremost choice for a basic as well as a power users need
this is a power browser i really like the extensions that i can install i am disappointed that i cant use the app on my dex station samsung s 10  it would be amazing if it work on dex mode 
i am absolutely happy with this web browser i have been using it for a long time on both my laptop and android phone the only thing its not an issue or complain though that i have noticed is that is consumes more power batteryenergy on my phone and data i just want to thank the developers for their colossal improvements over the years keep doing the good work
good application unfortunately the letdown is i get notified of the battery usage on it  had to go
drains the battery like nothing else video playback crashes frequently hangs requiring force stop too often its not really usable if you want to keep your sanity
love love love firefox appi dn worry about my phone when firefox is working on my cell phone so far greeeat co thankskeep up good work firefox
deoxyribonucleicacida nucleic acid that is the main constituent of the chromosomes of living cells consisting of two long chains of phosphate and suger units twisted into a double helix and joined by hydrogen bonds in a sequence that determines individual heredity characteristics
would be better if it didnt make me phone over heat or drain my battery
been happy with app for ages now it is raping the battery app info says 8 but battery usage setting is 37  more than the screen uninstalling now
i love this browser it has many wonderful possibilities i like it better than chrome the default browser on android cell phones
i use it for all my internet services cell and all 5 computers at home

firefox i dont want google plz help me delete all google apps from this tablet  the reason google keeps trying to tell me what to do its like a big bully its on all myy cell phones i dont want the google play store either its forcing me to use that app google play store i would use gmail please advise what i can do
im happy with the idea of an open source project but for an average person the browser is quite confusing other than that its a great power full browser a huge thank you for your effort
good application but really need to be able to group tabs so i dont need to always have 20 or 30 open just so i can keep an eye one a few different websites at once if i was able to group windows in different groups it would solve my battery being drained and save alot of time plus i would put 5 stars
i use this on my computers and on my android tablets so of course i wanted it on my cell phone
battery hog i want to love firefox for the mission and nongoogleness of it but it destroys my battery background battery usage is insanely high have closed tabs told phone to put it to sleep in background and it still eats up 35 of battery overnight when phone is idle and im asleep
im extremely unhappy i cant add camelizer to firefox browser on my brand new samsung a70 cell phone why not 
update ok ive been using this browser on and off for about 4 years i was really enjoying it but ever since the more recent updates it has gotten slower and it seems like it has taken steps backwards to the point where it has become almost unusable cant wait till the redesign comes out i like it but it keeps uninstalling after reboot when i do a system update and phone restarts i have to reinstall firefox when battery dies and i recharge and turn phone on i have to reinstall
great app for your cell phone or smartphone response time on cellular network is fast always reliable no krasch for me i recommend this app
battery drains fast when playing videos in the background as opposed to other browsers
need a spectrum shopping app google i need a spectrum cell phone casing spectrum
pretty great having firefox on my phone but it seems that for some reason its always on in background and therefore drains my battery galaxy s5
so this aop has sped up since my last review but it is a power hog 11 of my power
this app drain battery more than other browser a lot and my cell phone is getting hot after 10mins using other browser like dolphin is much better
battery hog good browser but it uses way too much battery and memory it actually overloaded my cellphone and i had to uninstall it
i tried it because i wanted an alternative to chrome but im very disappointed the difference between them is huge chrome is better in any aspect firefox charge pages very slowly it cant block all the advertising it recharge more time the same page while im reading it its not compatible with a lot of app for external link and these are just few little problems i found using it the browser is ok for general use but too many little thinks issues etc create a very unfriendly browser
nice but it kills my phone battery if application not closed it sucks 70 of the phone battery in a couple of hours of my galaxy s9 it must be a bug but no new version released yet
firefox is great for accessing blocked sites and to register for social media accounts which other browsers like operamini would not register for you it would have a 5 star from me like i already rated it from my experience of this version it is reliable in speed and processing power when browsing the internet like am a web programmer i ise firefox to open my cpanel when creating a website and it makes the dashboard interface wider to access all softaware feastures
it used to be my default browser but since the last update it drains my battery 2146 of my daily usage and i havent opened it today rubbish
great mobile browser you can sync it with your desktop for bookmarks and has all the features and power of the regular desktop version of firefox firefox fan since 2006
191 mb on my phone drains as much battery as a phone made in the early 2000s
thanks for enhance tracking protection  now i can browse without seeing any ads on my web pages thank you once again because now i can browse without my phone getting heat and the browser now consumes less battery  it is really now beyond classy it is the best browser right now on google play store with this update  but one more request please can you ad for us hiding phone notification bar and videos assistant  thank you
used over 1gb of storage constantly runs my battery dead there are better mobile browsers
reguire cell or mobil  only landline heart cond no cell
i l liked it but unfortunately it drains the battery in background disinstalled
golf now  twice has over charged my account due to their screw ups no one to talk to  no place for help and feed back i would seriously consider not using this app
it does not adapt to my cell phone screen 
i use firefox on my pc and i prefer its mobile version to chromes better layout reader view noticeably less ad targeting etc but unfortunately this app is totally unusable for me because it drains my phones battery for some reason this happened on 2 or 3 different devices in multiple attempts over the course of a few years i install and use the app my battery starts going down fast i go look for the culprit and firefox has an unreasonably high  of battery usage a fatal flaw
very slow and full of annoying notifications when i run it even after exiting it drains the battery of my phone making it really hot until i reboot the phone then it has the hide to pop up messages telling me to use firefox to reduce my carbon footprint i think ill uninstall it and go back to chrome as i can actually browse a web page with that and not have to dismiss so many pointless notifications that insult me and waste my time
battery consumption very high  i think its double to my previous samsung browser
works great but crippling battery drain on galaxy s8 other well known browsers work better
simple elegant customizable fast and powerful without eating hardware power
excessive battery drain when im not using my phone even with sleep options enabled
battery usage has been crazy for a few weeks switching back to samsung internet until the issue gets fixed
im not sure if it really drains much of my battery life quickly or just a bug on the battery api but all in all its a good browser thank you
this works well enough but a lot of pages arent formatted correctly and i have to open them in chrome the worst part and why im uninstalling is that it absolutely kills my phone battery it uses about 3x as much battery as chrome
such a power hog sucked up my battery within a few hours
i love this browser but it drains my battery i am forever getting notifications about putting it to sleep because it is using too much power i may have to stop using it for that reason
firefox works wonderful i can sync it to all my devices from my fire stick to my xbox to my cell phone to my pc without any problems but i do encounter one problem anytime i download anything and then try to delete the file i have to force close firefox reopen it and then im able to long click the item and click delete it or delete all
this app has vastly improved over the years but still uses illogical amounts of battery reading just one short article from my email could eat 10 of my battery life within less than 5 minutes
terrible already on my cell instructions not easy to follow
people who care about privacy should stop using chrome and switch to firefox really glad that firefox exists with more features for power users and extension support other browsers simply cannot match firefox
seems theyve finally fixed the hanging issue with the quit option getting stuck trying to clear private info it clears it almost instantly  closes the app thank you so much  now i wish it would actually kill the process properly instead of leaving it running in the background taking up megabytes of ramwhich translates to eating battery life unnecessarily
the experience was very much like playing an easy game that would make some like me who have a little knowledge about the new gadgets a savvy person of electronics i would then say that i would recommend this app to anyone thanks for sharing this app keep it up and more power guys
good browser however it drains my phones battery while running in the background would rate 5 stars if the browser wasnt so inefficient
i am here to learn about this app i only know through leptop i never use it on the cell phone but i will to use it and see i will then guaranty it is indeed working well to meet the need i have especially of the gospel library
wildly fast huh takes like 5 minutes to load even with good wifi this is clearly not designed for android and no effort was put into this app to optimize it for these systems also it drains the battery like crazy
i have been using firefox for a while without any issue but just recently i noticed that is draining my mobile data in a surprising way
my main gripe though is the widget i love having a search bar widget on my home screen this one basically saves you a single click to search than just opening the app normally 1 issue though is the lack of widget options customization i have dark themed icons and home screen like the look and battery saving the only option for this widget is a boxy white bar no options for color icon shape transparency etc i must be the only person who cares because i found no info anywhere
this was my favorite browser until your latest updates random crashes slow response high battery usage in addition it keeps freezing when watching live streams which dont have problems on chrome though and i rather not go back to chrome so fix it pleasesamsung galaxy tab s3 smt825
im trying to install it on my new cell phone but cant seem to have it set up on firefoxi
better than any other bit my cell has no space left for it dam it
been using it for years before cells were the only phone you could hsve love the bookmsrk feature
get the customisable private  free mobile browser that syncs across devices experience a fast smart and personal web firefox is the independentpeoplefirst browser made by mozilla voted the most trusted internet company for privacyupgrade today and join hundreds of millions who depend on firefox for a more personal browsing experience fastsmartsecure firefox is made with my mind and gives me the power to take back control of my web experiencemeet my expectations and gif supportthanks 
it is very fast and in order for u to get to save ur battery u must go into settings and go to the battery and start saving
everything is great but when watching movie on the browser it eats too much battery can you optimize this pls ill give you 5 stars if you do
love mozilla and firefox but the android version murders my phone battery life
firefox for pc is the best browser out there but somehow on andriod it becomes terrible uses to much cpu and ram and gives worst battery back up
had to uninstall twice in the past week my phone has run out of battery in the middle of the day firefox is always the top battery user at over 25 and i dont use it much
ridiculous amount of battery drain 30 in a matter of 2 hours when phone was at idle with the screen off i tried giving you guys another chance oh well
if youre not using chrome this is the next best or better thing pages load fast doesnt kill your battery its a solid web browser
gets worse with each update  it eats up way too much space vs samsung internet and chrome lags like crazy and bookmarks option stopped working data builds up way too quickly which increases battery and memory usage once i clear it everything via firefox ie bookmarks that i put on the home screen goes with it whose idea was this  samsung internet doesnt do this and this wasnt a problem in the past uninstalled it no longer saw a point in keeping it  stars for design only
no visible bookmarks toolbar i like being able to get to things fast and for the life of me i cannot figure out the settings on this or how to properly sync i love firefox better than any browser and it doesnt drain things like chrome does but this app doesnt come up to standard on a chromebook
firefox is tops imho yes it has some issues but then it is a work in progress but that is the nature of the beast mozila are constantly improving or developing their product and more power to them they are focussed on our needs so help them to go forward and stop moaning
extention support is good but battery drain is a major issue please solve tihs
hopefully not tracking so much as google chrome but crashes constantly eats battery a lot even if set as default browser some apps still use chrome or embedded android browser to open links
long time firefox user but seeing more and more issues with pages not loading properly switch to chrome and they load fine even worse though last few updates are causing significant battery drain like you mozilla but need to get issues fixed asap
excellent browser been using it for years on my pc and now my cell wouldnt change if i got paid to
doesnt feel quite right but the reason i uninstalled it is the battery drain
i used firefox browser on my phone for a while its great to usehowever ive experienced major battery problems in my settings is using more than 40 of battery power to than any other apps on my phone
poor notworking for most website compatability issue consume more power
this is very slow it would be nice to hear from a person who in charge
got this app as chrome kept redirecting me to an unsafe website which i couldnt stop great app apart from drains battery faster
huge battery drain on 1st gen pixel had to remove
good job more details weve had bad and good days with mozilla everyone had but even if they cannot satisfy us all they always followed their original goal and purpose to perfection it is the only reason today you access the web freely however you want many others would have been swallowed a long time ago by the giants profit making overlords of technology and web youve resisted temptation youve won the challenge of modernization you give us power everyday thnx long life mozilla
ditch chrome firefox is the best 1010 for giving the power back to consumer privacy  superfast browser well done team firefox
hmm well i swapped to this from chrome because this is clearer and easier to change the security and privacy settings which are better no doubt the trouble is this browser seriously drains my tablet battery and it doesnt load certain website pages well giving me black squares amazon is the worst i shall stay with firefox for a while longer then try another if it doesnt improve
overall firefox is fantastic sadly it uses a pretty substantial amount of battery on my phone oneplus 6t even days where i barely touched my phone firefox was number one in battery use and on those days i had podcasts playing for hours and that app was number two in the list so odd sadly i had to uninstall because of the battery drain issue
more cpu and battery intensive but more versatile than chrome still i appreciate that it renders pages equally as well as a desktop browser when i tap request desktop site to be fair im using it for tasks that even i7 desktops find demanding such as multiple amazon tabs the availability of plugins such as bitwarden and ublock origin is invaluable samsung galaxy s7 ps like open in new tab shows a switch to tab briefly in the corner dislike save as is missing
when watch an adult video through the browser and i push the power button to turn the screen off the video keeps playing while the screen is turned off also its not polished as a browser when a search result comes up sometimes there is a border around each search result
say no to the chromium cartel firefox is still the best browser for power users on pc and rather good on android as well
addons are a big advantage but the performance is bad eating much battery and that even on a samsung galaxy s7 edge
decent performance and many extensions are available also plenty of customization is possible battery usage is okay main disadvantage is lack of a decent dark mode with dark mode extensions performance is slowed and there are white flashes if you care about dark mode or want something faster check out samsung browser
no built in dark mode add this feature to save battery and to keep our eyes healthy
data stealing wont close runs in background stealling using power
the last update added bloatware and push notifications to tell you about the additional features draining your battery no one asked for
i thought it is a good idea to switch from chrome to   but sadly mobile firefox condumes more power and its comparatively slow to chrome now even in pc its slower than chrome thanks devs for letting our faith down on you 
the only major browser that still cares about your privacy and believes in giving power to the user you can already get a glimpse of the dystopian future google has in mind for the internet with how theyre making things harder for adblock extentions as a part of manifest v3 firefox was my first browser and once ads started popping up again this switch was a no brainer
it was supposed to work almost everything my battery are 4hrs later  disapirering and downloading it every 30mins useless
it consumes a lot of battery and dataplz dont install i am giving one star the app deserves zero star
slow and wastes battery i use firefox on my desktop but on mobile its so very slow to load pages or do anything its unusable and stressful cant copy any text i highlight which is annoying due to this feature being basic on other browsers great addons and how the tabs are laid out but speed is aweful i have tried a fresh install without addons and still very slow uninstalled and using opera instead which is very fast i can live without addons because i can open pages fast properly
so after not used firefox for awhile i decided to give it another try after using it for a few days i noticed significant battery drain compared to chrome along with that pages take 23x times longer to load and have timed out due to inactivity from browser went back to chrome and no longer have battery drain issues and pages are loading quickly again phone is an lg v35 thinq running android 8 slow speeds were on both att 5ge mobile data and on home 140mps down wifi
originally got this as an alternative to chrome on an old pc of mine it has never worked properly taking up to 10 minutes just to restore one tab freezes constantly and uses up almost all the power my pc had it claims to be fast yet even on an octacore 15ghz phone core2 quad 24ghz pc and numerous other devices it runs worse than chrome runs on my 99 dell dimemsion l550r  id reccomend staying far away from firefox
this browsing app has huge battery consumption which really sucks because i prefer it over chrome for many reasons but it just drains my battery too fast i have my phone plugged in and charging while using the app and my battery percentage is still going down at an alarmingly fast rate i love the app but i cant use it because it just kills my battery pretty much everything else about the app is great though
finally the full power flexibility and customization of the firefox browser has been brought to android firefox addons that increase privacy security and productivity now are possible on a mobile browser firefoxs code seems to have been optimized for android at last instead of a halfhearted port and the mobile fox is snappy and responsive  even with 23 addons installed the king is back long live firefox
nice browser fast but its a bit of a battery hogger samsung have a feature call device core firefox according to device core uses 24 of the battery within 18 minutes samsung browser only uses 4 within the same time frame im definitely deleting this one
not even a one hell is this company they let you download movies music ect cause they harass you as you delete thier illegal run stealing activist they block steal all music movies plus more and share your info illegally like google to thier memory so you get nothing paying your cell bill for nothing its arab run any questions now thier attacking america for real so illegal they should be in prison for these unlawful actions but good luck not finding prejudice amen
pretty useless on my sgs plus the device gets stuck and hot living me the one option only taking out the battery uninstalled unfortunately
adios fox sorry mozilla but after tollerating this app for a long time im removing it ff for android feels like its been abandoned in beta a real shame as i am losing the themes and the ad blocker which for me are the killer addons but i need a browser that doesnt run like a clockwork toy hola chrome edit having removed ff i note my battery lasts longer is firefox bad for the planet too
ive used firefox for what 8 years or something  a long time pc i have no issues with but mozilla needs to up their game for mobile this drains my battery crashes constantly always freezing and losing my webpage switch to cm browser if you want a legitimate mobile browser
drains battery quickerloads slower than chrome but has mobile addon support that chrome lacks has had a sloppy update in the past that disabled said addons but hopefully theyve learned to test more thoroughly now before pushing updates through
one thing that needs to checked out is that the s10 is telling me firefox is a high user of battery strength
downloaded to link to my pc but its too slow and drains the phone battery excessively switching back to chrome
consuming more battery in my app list and downloading also too slow while comparing other browser
the browser has everything you need except battery usage drains battery heavily compared to other browsers out there
its an all around better option to power my personal network
its a great browser but my phone constantly tells me that firefox is heavily draining my battery and i dont know why update seems like the issue has been fixed
i set it to not play videos automatically but they do on cell costing me money for things i dont want please fix
firefox isnt a very good browser like it should be but i dont want it to over power google or even any of its products so to speak and that all i got to say
battery drainer sometimes tabs will go blank requiring a force stop im a big firefox supporter but the droid app news some major work i like the layout however and the ability to use addons
firefox is a great browser for the computer but its very power hungry on the phone battery drains very fast even when not using firefox first time i installed it i noticed significant battery drain i uninstalled it and noticed the battery lasts longer reinstalled again and hardly used and battery life went down again
i just love this app even if sometimes its slow firefox top three its like giving power to help the other apps work
ive used firefox for many years on all my devices but of late this mobile version is causing issue on my phone as it will not close so runs constantly so my phone keeps complaining its draining my battery this also means it keeps the webpage last visited open so you cant go to home page i have tried reinstalling it but still the same which means i have no choice but to uninstall it to cut the battery drain its causing
although it drains some battery speed is good no problems with opening multiple tabs on the downside shows some script errors on flash based pages and the worst part is that some sites like google superuser gmail do not open they show an error secerrorunknownissuer the worst part is that theres not enough information about this on mozilla support pages this wasnt expected
im calling bs on the guy claiming the app drained 15 of the battery with four tabs running for 5 minutes mine has drained 1 in 7 minutes and it is still running in the background good browser with average battery drain looking forward to using this in place of chrome
this app has had a memory leak bug for four years now and no sign it will ever get fixed after running this for three days it corrupts memory necessitating a system reboot on kitkat or many apps stop working or the system grinds to a halt on current operating systems it eats battery even when quit if you dont totally kill it page renders are great though just a shame it leaves so much junk running in ram
seems to be draining power since the last 1 or 2 updates
i love this browser on my sony xperia performance its the very best browser i have ever used on my cell phone keep up the good work
ive been using firefox for quite a while now but with the last couple of updates it has been very slow in loading up and it seems to really kill the battery on my lg g6
this browser is great and the sync feature is also useful my only problem here is i noticed that this browser takes a lot of battery 935 of my power consumption for the last 12 hours  and i only used the app for half an hour
firefox is a good browser and im sad to say but its unusable due to the battery i have a samsung galaxy s8 and close out my apps when im done using them out of 96 of my battery used throughout a day firefox was responsible for 38 of it even though its usage time was about 18 minutes
very fast and way more battery efficient than google chrome
i have used firefox on multiple platforms for many years the latest android version is accessing my camera at random points and causing excessive battery drain beware of this app
helping me take power away from crooked browsers and overreaching technology thank you im in deep and you provide a big shovel
i love firefox its the only browser that works on my cell phone and when i visit starbucks
best browser ever only down side is its way too white it would be awesome for a pure black version to save us some battery on amoled screens
firefox is my go to inset browser works fine fails safe and drains to the bilges
ublock origin on mobile need i say more well built in privacy mode disable autoplay videos except on youtube great speed performance and battery life moreover you are supporting a free and open internet
i have used firefox for many years i consider it the most secure product on the market because it is constantly improving due to the dedication of their programmers who incidentally donate their time free of charge unlike other products that are governed by the almighty dollar
finally a smoother scrolling effect but still not as smooth as in opera touch for users with amoled displays you can set it with an addon called dark background and light text to have a pitch black bacground on every website you visit very relaxing for eyes and battery friendly i wish we had this option implemented in browser appearance settings as a standard
im enjoying this much more than the battery draining every move i make tracking chrome
works pretty bad lately it drains battery really fast when in background for example it drained 43 of my battery in last 8 hours overnight my battery app monitor says audio was on for last 8 hours
this is a disaster my battery was drained in a minutes and wont charge till i completely stop app app is great but problems with power wasting stopped me
kaspersky battery saver shows firefox is always running may be even the good guys need to monetise to survive but why not do it openly why hide
great firefox app so far i use firefox on my laptop and wanted to sync with my cell have had a great experience with the pc software
id give it 5 stars if it was lighter on system resources constantly getting the message that firefox is using an abnormal amount of resources and my battery drains so much faster with firefox compared to opera browser
erases all the pages saved as pdfs when the history is erased thats a lot of work down the drain also no obvious way to change the download directory what garbage coding
got tired of searching and running into ads with no ability to filter and so on mozilla gives you privacy control and customization addons only if you look for it but theyre great give you all the power and control to surf as you wishthank you
this latest version 6401 is worse than the last last version started gobbling up battery and data for no clear reason this version simply wont connect or load pages four out of five times need to reboot phone each time to use it several other browsers on same phone have no issues android 810 on a samsung j327 going to be uninstalling
it laggs it takes up battery and it is the best app ever
only down side is that it drains battery other than that it is official
slower than chrome and drains battery but because of addons its much better
recently it is draining the battery when in use i have compared it to chrome using both for the same time and firefox used 21 double to chrome please fix
i really enjoy using firefox when i change settings in firefox they stay changed the way i want them both of the other two major browsers have a tendency to every so often change my home page  search engine back to their preferences they frequently change my backup settings location settings etc i hate that firefox lets me be in charge of my browser i really appreciate that and it is extremely reliable and when a webpage with bad spot does crash my browser i find it easy to recovery the tabs i want to recover and only the tabs i want to recover excellent
when zooming so i dont have to strain to read text it does not readjust the text to the window so i have to scroll from side to side seems a bit faster at loading pages than before but still slow and having to scroll side to side is unacceptable please get your act together on android i so want to use your browser but you continually fail it has been many years now why is this so difficult for your developers back to opera i go program is now over 300mb wow old reviewwow mozilla terribly disappointed i do not have the time to wait on your browser over the years i keep coming back but your browser continues to be terribly slow 174mb bloatware i gave firefox another try as i am a big supporter but when it falls so short on crucial things not on an under powered device or slow internet pages load slow on all my devices i cannot find a way to make pages load in the background i open a tab in the background and when i finally go to it then it starts to load what a joke developer suggestions were how i use my browser therefore no help very long time firefox user but this is unacceptable surprised you have space in mobile with this atrocious browser mozilla fail dolphin browser is so much faster i would rather be running firefox but the load speed is unacceptable i value my time more than that please dont fail me on desktop i am trying to hold on this is mobile therefore screen real estate is crucial but firefox has an unnecessarily giant address bar with tons of wasted space fail black background with whitegray text helps save power and reduce eye strain there is an add on but the page loads twiceoriginal then inverted colors which makes your slow program even slower reduce the size of your notawesome bar screen real estate is essential you should not have to be informed of this very disappointed with this product
great browser for both pcandroid deviceit take reasonable memorypower and also no heating  hanging issue
version 57 noticeably improved performance and battery life ui feels sort of cramped at times
kept crashing ate up battery in the span of 2 hours
had to delete using 40 of battery when not in use ive used firefox for 15 years now sad to have to delete it but switching to chrome til this is addressed
i think this is very useful app for me and my cell phone
i use only firefox some bugs sometimes i press the go button to browse to a website after typing a url and nothing happens until i close that tab and try with a new one today long pressing links only seems to highlight textcant open in a new tab the tab interface should have a faster way to switch sometimes android warns me that firefox is draining my battery
works great most of the time my only complaint is when android system notifies me that firefox is draining my battery even though i prevented firefox from running as a background process this setting seems to have no effect
overall nice app but battery consumed too much please fix it
has been my default browser for years and i absolutely love it it integrates seamlessly with the system and gives me the power and freedom i have learned to expect from mozilla
recently all my saved password lost i even didnt update it but problem happened also we cant export our bookmarks switched to chrome aslo consuming a lot of battery in background
the cell came with this app i do not want iti only want google
no movies 4 halloweenwants to charge me again againect thank you
drains battery have to force close it all the time to stop draining the battery and even then in 10min it starts running in the background again draining more battery
i love to use firefox whenever i watch my fav kdrama thanks firefox and more power
i had it installed and it seemed ok then one of my antivirus apps told me it was draining my battery i uninstalled it and now my battery is lasting much longer between charges bye bye firefox
everything is best just its draining battery a lot please fix this issue
good browser but drains battery like mad become unusable after full charge without opening firefox app it drained 15 of battery in 15mins
i have been using firefox for android nearly from the time it was introduced without problems and in the past it performed well but the last update resulted in extremely high battery drain  i usually operate in airplane mode and am able to run 45 days without a recharge  firefox now consumes 74 of battery power and battery life has plummeted 7585 even though android doesnt show it as an active app and the low battery warning sounds within 24 hours  ive manually stopped the application and disabled notifications to see if battery drain returns to normal  if it doesnt firefox will be gone for good from my device  this is something that should never ever have passed testing before deployment
edit i will be getting an alternative to firefox soon since mozilla is reaching beyond strict user safety and going into destination censorship i will miss the greatness of firefox   more privacy more power over my own browsing bookmark importing and synching and encrypted password storage rock on mozilla rock on
always liked firefox but something has changed this browser is basically unusable for me now its unbelievably slow top that off with it heating my phone up now and ive had to go a different route
has been my go to browser on both mobile and desktop but something in a recent update has resulted in it draining my battery at a scary rate  eg today my phones been on battery for 12 hours firefox has been used for 2 mins and its 22 of battery use cant use it in its present state
it is the best browser in android store but it drain to much ram memory
i got a warning saying that firefox is using 113 of battery and needs to be stoppedput to sleep i never got such notification from chrome
this is a decent alternative to chrome but i often have problems with the browser becoming unresponsive it just wont go forward or back a page and links wont load sometimes if it sits long enough pages will eventually load without any indication or load bar most times i have to restart the browser notifications also often get stuck and wont clear unless i force close the app the experience just feels unpolished and slow this may have marginally better battery life but chrome definitely loads pages with better site compatibility and performance i love firefox for desktop but this just doesnt cut it to be my mobile browser of choice
actually its 45 star rating app but due to high battery usage rating decreased to 4 fix it otherwise its good app
a better designed mobile web browser than google chrome supports extensions and also has more useful builtin functionality than chrome except for an apparent lack of support for autofilling payment info into forms via info stored in google pay i end up switching browsers when buying online selecting text is a disaster and takes way too much time to get right in firefox also browsing in firefox always seems to deplete my battery very quickly if firefox fixed its quirks on android the negatives mentioned above mainly it would easily become my fulltime browser i wish it could be for now it isnt as my battery life and patience is precious note also that unfortunately desktop firefoxs killer new privacy  security feature containers is missing from the android version 
i love it its fast and good working the only bad thing is it take a lot of your battery
i trust the pc version as being more secure by default from other browsers and enjoy it in my cell for the limited use it utilize it for
my s4 came with chrome which is nice but sometimes goes crazy and drains my battery firefox is a great replacement that doesnt do this
easily the best browser but the battery consumption is bad
generally a good browser the only negative point for me is that it doesnt stay completely switched off even when i manually force stop it in the android apps settings given that firefox is rather large thats an issue for my small ram and also for my battery life
make sure to add the adblocker ublock origin your phone battery and your brain will thank you
it does not waste battery not runs in background just have my respect chrome is disabled
firefox kept my phone awake 5 hours yesterday ran the battery dead uninstalling solved the problem
loved it  great replacement for firetube to run youtube videos on background though it has a good impact on battery but still its awosome
"its a best browser i have used ever their is no doubt about that even 
though am also facing some issues like while streaming videos online my 
device is heating up rapidly and also system pops a message that firefox 
browser is draining battery i hope u gays can fix"
"keeps playing videos even after ive changed screens and wont stop unless 
i shut down firefox also using a lot of battery power lately"
"i really like firefox but anytime i use this app my phone crashes 
overnight and my battery doesnt charge ive seen it at 100 and then less 
than an hour later it shuts off and the battery is at 32 id end up late 
to work because my alarm wouldnt go off because of it it was driving me 
crazy i didnt know what was causing it until i realized it was this app 
now that ive deleted it it hasnt happened since"
"a lot of the issues that were present in the previous versions has finally 
been fixed  excessive ram hogging slow scrolling etc thanks to the 
developers for taking such stern actions however some issues are still to 
be improved firefoxs battery consumption and ram still has enough space 
for improvements to be made loading times are satisfactory but actually 
are higher than that of the other browsers as many are also suggesting 
the ability to have the address bar at the bottom would also be a delight 
i hope firefox android will be back to its former glory once these 
improvements are made"
"need another device to use account everyone on the forum is rude and 
condescending towards people with questions cant change download 
location literally zero customer support im gonna go charge up my 
nintendo dsi because the stock nearly decade old opera browser on that is 
far better than this junk"
"its says to connect to another device so that i can have a backup of 
history password etc how two emails or cell numbers please help thanks"
"id like to give a better review i use firefox at home and love it 
however this app crashes all the time even when im using other apps it 
runs in the background and i get a popup that it has crashed it drains my 
battery in the background pretty severely and stops spotify while im 
browsing not sure what thats about also it loads even simple websites 
very slowly so its really not worth the headache right now running s8 
with nova homescreen"
"would give 25 but cant do half stars battery drain usage is sporadic 
between versions and little care is given to preserving the user experience"
drained 60 of my battery in an hour in background
"dear firefox i am a samsung user so i kindly suggest you to add a black 
theme in your next update as i use firefox for long time i drains more 
battery for me"
"the new quantum ideology is amazing light on ram  battery but for some 
reason basic functionality is bugged i have enabled clear private data 
on exit when i surf a little bit  try to exit the browser it takes ages 
to clear the data  the browser never quits i have to manually force stop 
the browser please fix this i would appreciate the option always private 
mode instead of clear private data on exit that would be great"
"i love firefox on my laptop so i decided to try the cell phone version its 
very slow i tried viewing videos on websites and they would never play"
"no way to import bookmarks from chrome thats dumb and ui is just not 
great small page and active buttons difficult to press doesnt recognise 
torrent files for downloading in utorrent lotsa little thingsand is now 
a resource hog and battery drain"
"other than some layout differences some website rendered the desktop 
version instead of the mobile version some layout doesnt render quite 
right on some web site and feels just a tad sluggish compare to mobile 
chrome all is good i also noticed when using this browser it seems to 
use up more system resources ie cpu running a bit warmer use a bit 
more battery power than chrome"
"very feature rich especially when using addons the options for privacy 
and security are better than any other mainstream browser now with the new 
rendering engine performance is also good still a bit more power hungry 
than chromium based browsers"
"somehow it seems to be constantly draining battery i am not sure the 
reason for this but whenever i use firefox there is a massive battery 
drain"
"the last few updates have definitely increased battery drain i almost 
always get a warning on my phone no tabs opened either"
"32917 19 battery usage with just a few tabs open phone becomes hot 
during use gonna get cancer of the fingers from the extra radiation i 
guess firefox is an apt name maybe this app caused samsungs to catch 
fire  older versions made browsing erratic jumps from small to large 
font and back again unusable will have to uninstall  try another browser 
going forward"
"slower than chrome but has adblocking capabilities drains your battery in 
30 mins i went from 90 to 30 it still collects data from you for crash 
reports so you can forget about privacy aspect the only you would need 
it is for adblocking"
"too much power hog crashes often due to poor ram management the only 
reason i use it in my phone is to sync bookmarks with my desktop"
"its pretty good well rounded browser and compared to previous versions 
much less of a battery hog only issues i have so far is i turned off 
search suggestions but it still offers suggestions and at times it appears 
that since i switched to firefox on my phone the phone will get fairly 
sluggish after awhile"
"this app works very very well but it absolutely destroys your battery 
life i had an ad blocker with it as an extension so i can only assume that 
didnt help but my battery went from all day to 3 hours and now after 
uninstalling it its not dying anymore"
"the best browser ive been using firefox in the last three years and i can 
really feel the heat in my eyes and fingers anybody should try this no 
regret"
"please add a black status bar or a night mode i downgraded just for this 
because it messed up my notifications bar too so imunable to see battery 
time etcalso keeps crashing in mobile and pc  taking ages to loadit 
was the best browser now i had to switch to another on both pc and mobile 
i was trying to do online order and was constantly refreshing the payment 
pageand lots of more problems were to start sorry but not a trusted 
browser since last update"
"soooo this browser i was pretty excited to download it since i have it 
on my pc but there was a problem or two battery life  cpu usage only 
very effective when watching videos of 30 seconds or more this post was 
made in 2017 of july and up to this point in time im still 
experiencing that problem"
"latest updates has started to use more battery would run my phone down 
within 8 hours running dolphin browser now and tripled my battery life 
fix that and ill come back to ff"
"overall very good but giving it a 1 star due to battery drain there is no 
point having a mobile browser which i have to manage individually due to 
its battery draining this is a known issue"
a few days ago my battery was depleting faster than usual once i deleted firefox it proved that the app has been eating away my battery even though i closed it in the background i dont know why this is happening but until this problem is fixded im reluctant to reinstall
unfortunately its unresponsive battery drainer quite outdated design i cant imagine how it came to have 44 rating
latest version chewing the battery 50 percent drain in 4 hrs when not even using it stats show its by far the biggest battery hog was updated yesterday
this latest version is killing my battery battery monitor shows 15 drain for 2 minutes of use
for a low end phone 1 gb ram this app is very heavy on resources its slow and uses a lot of battery  if it was not for the add on s i wouldnt use it on android at all why doesnt mozilla spend some time on reducing the memory footprint
my hauwei mate 8 mobile over heating while workingplz fix the issue
this is browser very good but firefox quantum is only for computer and not for mobile please make firefox quantum for android because i hate yandex browser i need extensionsaddons and power but firefox not have power
much slower than chrome and drains battery takes more memory than chrome
the app is great havent had any problems with it  that sometimes it has high power usage when running in the background
i know this browser is one of the best but a little difficult for me lg x charge
i only use this because chrome mobile doesnt have addons lately firefox has been absolutely guzzling my battery using many times more battery than any other app on my phone even when im not using it at all hope this gets fixed soon or ill have to uninstall it
the new feature form mozilla to firefox is attractivebut it kills battery power more than others
theres a serious bug on my s8 the browser only shows a quarter of of the screen im pretty sure this only happens when im not in power saving mode my psm makes my resolution change so i assume thats the issue
good browsing app but drains battery really quickly i was having to charge at least twice a day sometimes more switched to edge and now have battery to spare at the end of the day
give up mozilla very very slow battery drainer youre way behind chrome and opera
once opened and post closing i find the battery tanks heavily even while attempting to charge  is that the app or things hiding in it
well read ur facebook page that ur kicking google chrome butt in speed and seems like by alot but when i tryed it its way slower then google chrome i may as well go back 2 chrome but i guess it was ment for the computers not android cell phones when u said u was faster then chrome ha so laim if it helps at all i have a samsung galaxy s6 bye firefox hello google chrome
the install size could be smaller and it sucks more battery than chrome  good browser though
its not upto the mark the top level totally white background  we could not able to see signal or time or battery indicators it covers everything  its annoying and also no night mode feature too
painfully slow at loading web pages whereas previously this worked fine  plenty of available drive capacity and processing power on my device might be time to abandon firefox in favour of chrome dare i say it 
keeps restarting and running in the background using battery  up
if the developers fixed the choppy rough scrolling and fixed the issues with battery draining 510 every time i open a 40 second youtube video sometimes even mp4s posted to reddit do it this could easily be the best browser i love that i can install adblock extensions chrome really sucks for disallowing that but at least it doesnt drain my battery and jump all over the place when i scroll through pages firefox is just too rough it needs to be smoothed out
i am surprised that the changelog doesnt seem to mention speed improvements which was my biggest gripe with the app before it will probably be my default browser now though i will be keeping an eye on battery usage
getting disapointed with firefox lately if its not locking up on the computer its doing the same with the mobile version as well and fyi my gear has the latest versions of software like the computer and my cell phone is new so dont tell me those are the issues sorry if anything can be fixed to solve the speed issues and fix the freezing issues that would be nice been a faithful user of firefox for years but now im subject to using google chrome because it dont give me issues like those so please do what you can for future fixes thanks
froze lagged pretty much destroyed my phone  wouldnt let me click drained battery and reallyjust pissed me off
this browser caused performance problems with my lg v20 like freezing lagging and battery drain  had to uninstall
please optimize the battery life  can you guys add a feature of data saver like in google chrome
this once awesome browser has become incredibly slow and energy draining and now i discover that i cant even select and copy text within a hyperlink i know this seems like a trivial gripe but its the little things that make or break our enjoyment of critically important frequently used apps
big hype not enough juice its simply not fast certainly not faster than chrome also the x in the address bar does nothing it does not clear the current text and should probably be updated or removed the backgrounding of links is a nice feature
just like always i download firefox mobile all excited about it it isnt chrome its awesome i use it faithfully for a few weeks and then the rot sets in it slows down dramatically it crashes randomly it wont load pages anymore just black it uses battery like the last one was made and none of them can be charged anymore i really get discouraged with this browser it could be great it isnt even good enough for meh right now
stops responding  constantly need to power cycle to reset
firefox is suddenly massively draining my battery the last i checked it used 96 even though i had hardly used it at all ive liked using firefox as my main browser but if this continues ill have to delete
consumes too much battery lifeeven when in backgroundneed some work done on this problem
not a good android browser  firefox quantum may be great in the pc but on android it drains battery like crazy
this an awesome app but it takes away half my battery
my preferred mobile browser however  im getting constant warnings from android oreo that firefox is draining my battery
i have switched to firefox as my go to browser on pc but this app just absolutely killed my phone battery if they fix the massive battery drain id give it a 5 star rating
the latest update sucks the interface is ugly and it chews up my battery like no tomorrow i dont want my android to look like an iphone if i wanted that i would buy a damned iphone
why does this app keep running in the background even when youre not using it unnecessary battery drain uninstalled
why is it in the updated version notification and status bar of phone look at blank and white i cant see time or battery status while browsing anymore fix it
i used this in my pc first than sync it to my cell im anxious for it to download
status bar at the top is complete white it hides all important details like mobile signal battery status and time
i used to prefer firefox on my android before the last updates since then its been the cause of extremely severe battery drain my phone would go from full charge to nearly dead within 4 hours of complete nonuse which happened repeatedly with two different batteries aside from being aesthetically awful compared to the previous version its slower than chrome this version is a complete failure dont waste your time downloading it
i got a battery drain warning on galaxy s6 edge 
good browser but what a drain on battery light to moderate use was responsible for a full 30 of my battery life during a normal day in my pixel back to chrome i go i guess
takes quite a long to load page status bar blends with the notification area making it impossible to see the battery pecentage or anything else and it is  quite heavy on system
very good browser that is safe and fast but only downside is that it consumes lot of memory and battery firefox need to improve in that area
crashes battery drain unauthorized background activity report made by phone company
you should feed firefox before releasing it   unfortunately the new firefox is a total disappointment it ate 40 of my lg g5 battery in an idle period i used to prefer firefox to be my browser but you guys kept changing it to the worse actually ive started believing firefox uses my phone for hidden cryptocurrencies mining
great browser but i get repeated warnings regarding battery usage hope this can be rectified soon
congrats youre the only app ive had on this phone that i get constant warnings for power consumption on and thats when im not even using it and no refresh option from the default display seriously was hoping this would be an improvement but just more of the same awful gs8
been using firefox since version 10 on the desktop over ten years ago and its still handsdown the best browser available on any platform its had its growing pains on android but sync works beautifully now scrolling is smooth as silk the ui is polished and intuitive and the clincher addon support on mobile a decade on and its still simultaneously easy to use and a power users dream the crown jewel of the open source community long live mozilla
great new update quantum power in my phone lightning fast
previous version has compatibility with addon quitnow current is not  would be very appreciated if developers makes modifications to be able install addon mentioned above otherwise firefox allways running and  consuming battery ram
app was good but it drains battery more yesterday i check battery consumption android system was 984 and firefox 2560
this new firefox sucks i prefer firefox but it cannot bring up a webpage with just low cell signal bars but the old one could and chrome can waste of space uninstalling it for now
love the new design and logo simple clean design is great but now i cannot see my icon bar at the top off the screen the white colour washes out my battery and signal and clock and have tobclose the app to see it
long time firefox user as default browser on both windows 10  android  its a welcome update smooth transition between tabs  seamless sync is the power of mozilla   all the best for your future endevour
quick battery draining firefox drains my battery from 20 to 1 in almost 30 minutes where other browser only drains 68 percent other than that all good
much better than before addons and themes on mobile is priceless also neat features in general there are a few things that i encountered that was slightly bothering me last pass accessibility just plain doesnt work and had to fiddle with the checkboxes to toggle them oh and battery consumption is noticeable but thats just based on feeling awesome browser
a real upgrade at least for my phone it is im often wary of updating apps because of issues that often plague new versions but this one is true to its word its fast faster than my old ff version lighter less lag and surprisingly less taxing on my battery the only thing i didnt like was how the interface reminded me of google chrome but i guess thats small a compromise the pocket recommendations on the front page is a great addition too even if its repetitive if you use the pocket app itself lol also a little bugged by the twocolumn tiling of tabs instead of the previous long list it was other than that firefox is still the best
battery drainer used over 1hr of battery in the background
hi in the new update white colour status bar is not good it merges with time battery percentage network signal icons  the black status bar in incognito window is perfect and nice can u fix it plz
since the new update to go along with the new firefox quantum the browser is a lot slower now and takes up a lot of battery til those issues get fixed itll be a 2 star in my eyes afterwards itll go back to a 4 star
please add a quit option it consumes a lot of battery because it seems to run in the background thanks
your new update is not standard update again then i give you 5 in my device when i use this browser new update i dont see my battery percentage  data speen and so on pls fix it
been using firefox for years but just found out i can use it on my cell
new ui and miuixiaomi dont look great together makes the topbar white however all the text battery time icons remain white too cant see them while using ff  and guess what not using it now
this new update is horrible white status bar prevents me from seeing notifications went from perfect to a glaring eyesore  edit  whoever is in charge of of app design needs to have there employment terminated this is the worse update ive ever seen
after last update i cant see bar with time network and battery status i use miui 8 could you please fix it
in the new update i cant see my phones network battery etc bar for this versions white backgroundvery disappointed after this new update can we change white background to black
i really love the ui of the update but its burning through my battery ive used it on my pixel on screen 12 minutes today  im 26 battery down thats unacceptable please fix this asap i dont want to have to use another browser
the only browser which makes my phone to get heat
post nov 17 update ui is just ugly colour scheme choices are jarring and look straight outta the ms playbook  seriously pocket this again the option to turn it off is there its just not obvious i assume this is intended to stop folks turning this junk off also hung my phone on first start had to pull the battery
best browser good performance and no hanging problem no battery killer alike other browsers
my only issue with this last update is it made the screen this bright sterile white even on my lowest screen setting its still piercing please add an adjustment not only would less light be nicer for me  but it should also improve power usage slightly
found it was draining my battery excessively and hated the new interface
the good its faster the bad theyve fouled up the top sites home page screen there used to be 9 thumbnails on the page along with the list of recent sites visted but that seems to be gone  8 icons may be enough for a cell phone but not a tablet and certainly not a computer  mao the number of pinned sites user configurable and bring back thumbnails  the unchanged you still cannot edit your bookmarks and organize them into folders like you used to be able to on the pc version
using firefox is easy and smooth i just dont know if i like the new aesthetics my phone burns things onto my screen pretty easy and im a bit wary of the white just noticed i cant see my battery percentage when im on it unless i get really close to the screen
used to be the best  now it locks up multiple computers and cell slow and a resource hog  what happened
please just fix its battery use   i used it for 5 minutes and it used 2083 mah power
used to be awesome now not at all constantly dumps ram on closing eats way too much ram and battery and can no longer move to sd firefox was my only browser now i need another thats not so resource heavy
i just want to get to my bank account instead you idiots insist i get n id off my cell phone   iam pissed
best one  want to improve ur battery life install and notice ur self
are you really mozilla there is no similarity between the beautiful web browsing experience that you give on desktop and on android phone worst web browsing experience where is the home button where is the feedback button why cant we send our feedback from google play if you want to improve the browser you have to let us send the feedback dont design the browser as you like and call it the best i use only firefox on my desktop and chrome in my cell phone
using more memory space and huge battery draining apart from this it was good
doesnt hangs like chrome or opera does improved battery life and  i can use n sync it in real time with laptop  also tention free for paswords it keep all of them secure with master password n sync too  with laptop  no bogus updates as chrome have n it is so simple to use  please improve more fluidity
was told that you could download internet videos to your device  dont have the slightest idea how to make it do that   still cuts photos in half and stacks them on top of each other making a pdf wont copy all content to pdf  only 3 stars because my issues have not been addressed  will not shut off runs in the background and runs down your battery when making a pdf file it copies the top and bottom page controls and interfers with text makes making a pdf useless still cuts pics in two when making a pdf doesnt show arrow when making pdf  open tab shows for 12 second it makes pdf files with no content blank lovely
one of the best app less resource consuming  doesnt drains battery
firefox is better in battery use reader mode is amazing just try and you will find more things about it
causes my tablet ngt5110 to start overheating within two minutes of opening firefox 560 i get the overheating warning and can feel the heat towards the bottom of my screen if i dont close ff the tablet restarts itself so frustrating
i think you need to rethink the way you do things i have a problem with your system i tried to get some help with it from jackass who wants to charge me money just to tell me why your system is screwing up
it works and is great on battery life but at the time of writing android had much better alternatives if you are married to the firefox account system for syncing bookmarks and such just stick with this one for convenience
hello guys do the have the option of darkblack mode on firefox on android this will be a great battery saver for amoled screen users
its trustful it consumes less battery n allow me to enjoy my service
i regret giving this app such a negative review for this has been my go to for years but lately it has been showing so many signs of instability im not sure whats happening but firefox causes my phone to drain heat excessively and reboot nearly unusable i thought my phone was just about to die but i went back to using opera and i never had any issues even firefox focus is doing the same damn thing
really improved version rolled out now able to view all videos without codec support ram and battery usage also good
not good switched to firefox from chrome as chrome was draining battery firefox was a little better than chrome but the user experience is just not comparable to chromes in any way infact only after using firefox i realised how much better chrome is and maybe thats why the battery drain
wow effective browserno more battery draining please improve page load performance
even with a high end smartphone with plenty of power firefox just seems sluggish plus web pages are still a little slow to load and render i so want to like this app but you need to remove all the bloat features and return to a simple fast secure browser
i love the desktop version but over the years this app version has become a burden to my phone since the last few updates it has been freezing and crashing on occassion and has become a big battery drain
my cell phone is getting very slow  i need an update on the browser
firefox used to be a great browser but now its not only a memory hog a battery killer it literally drains my battery so fast and when i go to look something up instead of going directly into firefox which is my main browser i have to touch the little black bar that comes up saying open in firefox ridiculous get it together you guys very poor quality too many megabytes each update too many updates as well
keep slowed over the time are this app getting old than going to die upg this app drain your battery cell quickly 
okay first things first firefox is a beast that guzzles battery i can go from 100 to 80 and lower in less than an hour my battery optimization apps try to shut it down all the time and even when im not using it it uses just as much battery sometimes ive clocked the memory usage at 1gb more than any app i have monitored saying that you get all the mod cons to be expected with firefox addons dedicated privacy features themes and a renowned familiar browsing experience and you get a browser from a company you can trust who are attempting to pioneer transparency in online privacy and have been championing the movement since time immemorial solid browser needs work though cant complain extensively though this is one of the best browsers out there with all its issues and bugs withstanding
huge battery drain percentage compare with android system within 2 days firefox background process is terrible
i absolutely love firefox its the only browser i use on my laptop or my phone the browser that came on the phone is a joke and chrome is slow as hell even if these things werent true the addons alone would make firefox worth using there are some amazing features with the addons i see the complaints others have but ive had no trouble at all it is true that it eats battery and thats definitely something that could be looked into to fix but i just downloaded some battery saver apps that boost the phone ram and problem solved i also really appreciate that firefox works to defend user privacy and is a nonprofit ill keep using it as long as these things remain true 
uses too much battery and kept phone awake for 10 hours overnight
im devoted firefox user over pc n checking out firefox android from past 2years but it still has many features missing n still not that easy going ui sync doesnt work clearing history is not one click method downloading is not that strong battery consumption is high sometimes it doesnt load images or videos present on page no option to watch videos in higher quality text rendering is still not superb still no customisation for ui as it looks too bland yes addons r big plus but basics r must
way better than chrome in terms of ram cpu and battery consumption so you will  get faster speed longer sot and never overheat addons need refining but has the capabilities is a huge plus for productivity already
some bugs power consumption is high like some of my apps still being available
i was noticing constant battery drain and stopping firefox usage brought back battery life uninstalled it permanently albeit i used firefox since its first beta release in 2013 as no one cared about the reports
it killed my battery on the first use it seemed to be operating when not in use
firefox is still my favourite browser but it is unbearably slow in the last couple of months 082017 really whats going on to this once power browser 
recently facing problem app is drawing too much power please fix the bug at earliest
what happened i used to like this app a lot and i really like the trackmenot feature  the only problem i used to have was that the app would mysteriously disappear off my phone whenever i would restart it it happened on 3 separate occasions but i kept redownloading it because it was at least useable then however recently i have been getting swamped in ads and pop ups when ever i browse even though i am using the ad blocker extension also the fact that all videos are opened in a new browser window instead of playing on the current page is a huge inconvenience and causes even more lag  this used to be my go to browser and i would use it multiple times a day because i prefer using 1 app for most of my internet related tasks instead of using a browser facebook etc and killing my battery in a couple of hours i have switched back to my old browser opera because it runs much more smoothly in general
meh   to be honest the only reason why i got this app in the first place is to play audio from youtube while on another tabapp or simply having the phone sleep this saving battery life you fixed it now it sucks plus its about as fast than a sloth on energy drinks no thanks
this browser is my favorite at pc and cell phone
it works well and has more customization and user freedom than most mobile browsers on the market making it one of the most powerful browsers available for phones  one feature that would really add to firefox for android would be the ability to manage bookmarks better like being able to move bookmarks and folders other than that androids version of firefox is a great choice for power users regular internet explorers and opensource enthusiasts on the go
would like to like this but my god is it a battery drainer  set my phone down for almost two hours to watch a movie and came back to 18 battery remaining  this was with over 75 to start  love ff on the desktop but mobile needs major optimizing to be usable
i love firefox and have used it for years on laptops the flexibility and relative security has been a big plus but fx on android has hardly ever worked without issues in the last couple of years it has been getting more resource hungry consuming ram and draining the battery it is now painfully slow sometimes becoming completely unresponsive sadly the time has come to say goodbye on android now using much faster brave
great browser but is an absolute battery hog on my s7 edge im constantly receiving alerts for high battery usage never had this problem with chrome considering switching back
laggy and when i power off my phone and start it up its deleted off my phone
i really like this browser than any other but am facing a problem it drains my battery sometimes in background even i am not using
uses quite a bit of  battery wants to run in the background all the time also it used to be fast it gets slower with every update now theres quite a few faster browsers available and no i dont have a lot of addons to slow it down its just slower test driving a replacement now
i don t really like it because it makes my phone battery drowning
give some reward points for browsing which can be used for recharge
slow and laggy compared to chrome and also drains the battery
the recent versions on numerous devices i have are so slow crash prone and overall make internet explorer on a pc look like a turbo charged cheetah over 1 tab and or slows down even more 3 tabs  yeah have fun with molasses
massive battery drain its also done something to my signal keyboard uninstalled
suddenly it overheats drains battery quick cpu intensive and is sluggish when in use
its fast its smart and its safe the firefox browser does what it claims to do so im quite happy with that but i challenge you to find another app that drains as much battery as this one when it plays video it might not just be with video but nevertheless when an app makes my phone discharge while it is being charged theres a problem not to mention the apps inability to play and 1080p video i like and it would be a lot better if it didnt have all these problems so please fix it
wont load pages crashes and drains my battery in 10 minutes
continual freezing slow operation laggy excessive battery usage and blurred text mean i can only give one star this is the same on a sony xperia z5 samsung galaxy s5 and samsung galaxy s7 complete utter rubbish uninstalled
firefox is a good browserafter using on pc luv to use it on phone thanks thanks to mozilla community for mozilla on android keep the power of open source going
i am at the point in removeing firefox from my tablet it keeps crashing and is becoming a big resource hog and uses to much memory if no issues on cell or desktop but my tablet keeps crashing if this problem is not fixed i will remove the app
i love firefox but lately its been eating up resources and killing my battery life
unfortunately it now seem to eat up battery use and heats up my s7 edge  fair well old friend it seem that the firefox team are unaware of all the growing low scores that too bad
it wouldnt be so bad if it would shut off or uninstall but it does neither just kills my battery and constantly hangs  laughs especially on the private brozer that wont go away either i hate it but thats my taste others may not have the same experience with it that i do
experience a fast smart and personal web firefox is the independent peoplefirst browser made by mozilla voted the most trusted internet company for privacy upgrade today and join hundreds of millions who depend on firefox for a more personal browsing experience  fast smart yours firefox is made with you in mind and gives you the power to take back control of your web experience thats why we design the product with smart features that take the guesswork out of browsing  search intelligently  ge
in all honesty as much as this browser is bearable on an i7 its absolute rubbish on android drains battery faster than the screen also about 68 times slower than puffin browser
its too much slow than chromeuse allot battery nd very slowi switched it desktop site but its nt good as chrome is
stupid been searching for too long after clicking never remember there is no way to undo this even downloading third party attachments cannot fix wasting time reading post after post step after step one wrong tutorial after another firefox can be stupid and broken it is annoying reading post after post for something so little and every bit of advice is wrong because firefox android is different from firefox   unable to tell if it is better on battery
ok im using firefox on my galaxy s4 only because its synced with pcs bookmarks and history as for performance lm not satisfied integrated browser is much faster than this when using 3g browser is consuming too much power im using firefox on my pc though and im pretty happy with it
ive recently changed from chrome to firefox due to high power consumption from chrome and firefox doesnt drain somuch but it is very slow and laggy on samsung s6 plus please fix this issue as im not the only one with this same problem
there is a problem with cache and cookies it is not connected to the wifi because i tried to log in with chrome at the airport charles de gaulle in paris there is a sign in after 2 checkboxes and after clicking a button after checking both website reloads leaving one checkbox unchecked i switched to chrome and everything works like charm as for tabs if my phone is the normal way vertical there is no space imagine working on sony e2303 alot of people have the same problem you should make tabs horizontally on the left screen so it slides from left side like cairodock does in linux mint with the ability to make your own icons on it and especially with new design making a switch from dark to light design to spare battery is also a good thing to do also there is a problem with syncing data i am logged in at the computer my tabs show up but at the mobile because there are no tabs they are in some list i need to click onmake tabs it will solve alot of problems also the themes i choose the one thats very dark because i lov dark why the hell you put transparent thing on every theme i cannot switch it off in any setting menu as i have small internal card and big xternal one the ability to download files to the card should be default one without using aboutconfig solution like showed at google it downloads to the card but not alot of people know how to do it especially if they arent programist or hackers like me the interface should be intuitive and well space designed maybe you the designers should take example from another well intuitively designed software called fruit loop mobile there they were able to construct multiple windows sliding on and off under buttons from manu sides that would make firefox revolutionary because all is about open source free access to knowledge applications right and if i need to switch applications insteae on working only in firefox then you failed and i dont have full access and skills to do it for you neither the time necessary if they can do it you can do it too good luck we are waiting for changes because we dont like using chrome from monopolist microsoft
used to be able to minimize the app to save battery now i guess they took it off probably to monopolize youtube even more
theres clearly a bug it takes 8 seconds or more before starting charging a web page i think im gonna uninstall it if clearing cache or data doesnt give nothing
fwiw im also using ff sync and ive read other people mentioning thats what causes the drain
still best browser  1 for losing the ability to play music and video while screen is off was such a nice feature to save battery and be entertained
it sucks this version uses way to much data i use to like firefox ill try the beta version and see how my data works and if it drains it like this version im done with firefox
love that its open source and sync with desktop is great but kills my battery so quickly compared to chrome
the safest mobile browser  with addons such as norton safe search and adblocker i feel more secure previously ad popup redirected me to dangerous paid services which even if i cancelled or closed charged money from my service provider cant thank enough the developers
i can play youtube videos in the background without having to pay 999 a month so 5 stars edit thats changed since google is dead set on charging 10 a month a feature that should be free
i loved firefox for its ability to continue to play media files esp youtube in the background while i did other stuff or turned my phone screen off to save power now that feature has been removed and i will be switching to chrome and leaving my review at 2 stars until this problem is fixed back to the way it was
used to be good for playing youtube in the background until they released a fix for it i no longer have a purpose for this app as it eats too much ram and my battery life would be worth it though if you could still play youtube in background going to 3rd party app 
far too slow and laggy feels like theres a massive memory drain isnt as clean as could be compared to chrome browser
guys what hpnd with youtube i notice if im power off my screenpaused the songs stops pls make it work again 
its a really good app but it drains your battery like crazy if you could fix that or tell me how to it would be all 5 stars
